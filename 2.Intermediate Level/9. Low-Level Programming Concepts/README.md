## Memory Management
- **Memory Allocation**
  - Static vs. Dynamic Allocation
    - **Static Allocation**: Memory allocated at compile time. Once allocated, it cannot be freed until the program terminates. Used for global and static variables.
    - **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory allocated at runtime using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` in C. This memory must be explicitly freed using `free`.
  - Stack vs. Heap Memory
    - **Stack Memory**: Used for static memory allocation. Functions and local variables are stored here. It operates on a LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
    - **Heap Memory**: Used for dynamic memory allocation. The size is determined at runtime and it must be managed manually by the programmer.
- **Ownership (Rust)**
  - **Concept**: Ownership is a feature in Rust that ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector. It enforces rules at compile time to prevent data races and memory leaks.
  - **Borrowing and Lifetimes**: 
    - **Borrowing**: Allows you to reference data without taking ownership. Mutable and immutable borrowing are supported.
    - **Lifetimes**: Specify how long references are valid to ensure they donâ€™t outlive the data they point to.
- **Ownership and Concurrency**
  - **Concurrency Model**:
    - Ownership rules prevent data races at compile time.
    - Guarantees thread safety without locks or atomic operations in most cases.
- **Garbage Collection**
  - Concepts and Mechanisms
    - **Automatic Memory Management**: Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.
    - **Mechanisms**: Implemented in languages like Java, C#, and Python to simplify memory management for developers.
  - Garbage Collection Algorithms
    - **Mark and Sweep**: The collector traverses all reachable objects starting from root references, marks them, and then sweeps through memory to collect unmarked objects.
    - **Reference Counting**: Each object has a counter tracking how many references point to it. When the count drops to zero, the object can be collected.
    - **Generational GC**: Divides objects into generations. Younger objects are collected more frequently than older ones, improving efficiency.
