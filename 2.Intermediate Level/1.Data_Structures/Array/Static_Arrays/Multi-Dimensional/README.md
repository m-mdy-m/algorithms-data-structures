### Multidimensional Systems (m-D Systems)

#### Introduction

In traditional systems theory, systems typically depend on a single independent variable, such as time. However, **multidimensional systems (m-D systems)** depend on multiple independent variables. These independent variables can represent spatial dimensions, time, or other parameters. This concept extends classical 1-D systems to handle more complex phenomena, such as processing images or signals that vary across multiple dimensions.

#### Multidimensional Space

A multidimensional space refers to a mathematical space with more than one dimension. In a 2D space, we have two dimensions (e.g., x and y), and in a 3D space, we have three dimensions (e.g., x, y, and z). The concept generalizes to higher dimensions (e.g., 4D, 5D), where each dimension can represent different variables or parameters.

For instance:
- **1D Space**: Represents a line.
- **2D Space**: Represents a plane (e.g., a flat image).
- **3D Space**: Represents a volume (e.g., a 3D object).

A point in an m-dimensional space can be represented by a vector with m components, such as $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m)$, where each $x_i$ is a coordinate in the i-th dimension.

### Challenges in Multidimensional Systems

Multidimensional systems introduce complexities that are not present in 1-D systems. Some key challenges include:

- **Factorization**: In 1-D systems, polynomial factorization is well-understood and supported by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. In m-D systems, however, polynomial factorization is more complex due to the nature of multivariate polynomials.
  
- **Stability Analysis**: Stability in 1-D systems is typically determined by the location of poles in the complex plane. In m-D systems, stability analysis is more challenging due to the lack of straightforward extensions of these concepts.

- **Causality and Realizability**: Determining whether an m-D system is causal (output depends only on present and past inputs) and realizable (can be implemented in a physical system) requires more advanced techniques.

### Applications of Multidimensional Systems

Multidimensional systems are applied in fields where data spans multiple dimensions:

- **Digital Image Processing**: Pixels in an image can be considered as elements in a 2D grid, where each pixel has spatial coordinates (x, y).

- **Medical Imaging**: Techniques like MRI or CT scans create 3D representations of the body, involving three spatial dimensions.

- **X-ray Technology**: 2D projections from various angles are combined to reconstruct 3D internal structures.

- **Satellite Communications**: Signals may be analyzed over multiple dimensions, including time and spatial coordinates.

### Linear Multidimensional State-Space Model

A **state-space model** is a mathematical framework used to describe the internal state of a system. In an m-D system, the state-space model captures the system's behavior across multiple dimensions.

#### Example: 2-D Linear System

Consider a two-dimensional (2-D) linear discrete system, where the system's behavior is described by the independent variables $i$ and $j$.

Let:
- **$u(i, j)$** be the input vector at coordinates $(i, j)$.
- **$y(i, j)$** be the output vector.
- **$R(i, j)$** and **$S(i, j)$** be the state vectors corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively.

The system's state-space equations can be described as:
$R(i+1, j) = A_1 R(i, j) + A_2 S(i, j) + B_1 u(i, j)$
$S(i, j+1) = A_3 R(i, j) + A_4 S(i, j) + B_2 u(i, j)$
$y(i, j) = C_1 R(i, j) + C_2 S(i, j) + D u(i, j)$

Here, $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2, D$ are matrices that define how the state vectors evolve and how the inputs affect the outputs.

### Multidimensional Transfer Function

A **transfer function** represents the relationship between the input and output of a system in the frequency domain. For m-D systems, this concept extends to multiple dimensions.

#### Example: 2-D Discrete System

Consider a 2-D discrete linear system described by a partial difference equation:
$a_{p,q} y(i, j) = b_{p,q} x(i, j)$
Where:
- **$x(i, j)$** is the input at coordinates $(i, j)$.
- **$y(i, j)$** is the output.
- **$a_{p,q}$** and **$b_{p,q}$** are constants representing the system's coefficients.

The 2-D Z-transform can be applied to convert this difference equation into a transfer function:
$T(z_1, z_2) = \frac{Y(z_1, z_2)}{X(z_1, z_2)}$
Where:
- **$z_1$** and **$z_2$** are the Z-transform variables corresponding to the independent variables $i$ and $j$.
- **$T(z_1, z_2)$** represents the system's behavior in the frequency domain.

### Realization of a 2-D Transfer Function

Realization refers to converting a transfer function into a state-space model, which is more suitable for implementation and analysis.

#### Example: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) System

Consider a 2-D system with a finite impulse response (FIR), where the output depends on a finite set of past inputs:
$y(i, j) = \sum_{k=0}^{N_1} \sum_{l=0}^{N_2} b_{k,l} x(i-k, j-l)$
Here, **$b_{k,l}$** are the system's coefficients, and the summation represents a weighted combination of delayed inputs.

To realize this as a state-space model:
- Define state vectors based on the delays in each dimension.
- Construct matrices **$A_1, A_2, B_1, D$**, etc., that map the inputs to the outputs through these state vectors, incorporating the delays and coefficients.

### Real-World Example: Image Processing

In digital image processing, filtering is a common operation where each pixel's value is adjusted based on its neighbors. This can be modeled as a 2-D system:

- **Input**: The original image, where each pixel is an input point.
- **Output**: The filtered image.
- **State Vectors**: Represent how the filter modifies each pixel based on its neighbors.
- **Transfer Function**: Represents the filtering operation in the frequency domain, which is useful for designing and analyzing filters.

For example, in edge detection, a filter might emphasize the difference between neighboring pixel values, highlighting the edges in an image. This operation can be described and implemented as a 2-D system, demonstrating the practical application of these theoretical concepts.

### Examples of 2D and 3D Matrices and Shapes

#### Example 1: 2D Matrix (2x3 Matrix)
A 2D matrix is essentially a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. For example, a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns) can be represented as:

\[
\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This matrix has:
- 2 rows: \([1, 2, 3]\) and \([4, 5, 6]\)
- 3 columns: \([1, 4]\), \([2, 5]\), and \([3, 6]\)

#### Example 2: 3D Matrix (2x2x3 Tensor)
A 3D matrix (or tensor) can be thought of as a stack of 2D matrices. For example, a 2x2x3 tensor can be represented as:

\[
\mathbf{B} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
7 & 8 & 9 \\
10 & 11 & 12
\end{pmatrix}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This tensor can also be visualized as two 2x3 matrices stacked along a third dimension.

#### Example 3: 2D Shape (Rectangle)

A 2D shape, such as a rectangle, can be described using its vertices (corner points) in a 2D coordinate system:

- Let the vertices be \((0, 0)\), \((4, 0)\), \((4, 3)\), and \((0, 3)\).

This rectangle can be represented as a set of coordinate pairs:

\[
\text{Vertices} = \{(0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (0, 3)\}
\]

#### Example 4: 3D Shape (Cube)

A 3D shape, such as a cube, can be described using its vertices in a 3D coordinate system. For a cube of side length 2 centered at the origin, the vertices are:

\[
\text{Vertices} = \{
(-1, -1, -1), (-1, -1, 1), (-1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 1), \\
(1, -1, -1), (1, -1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, 1, 1)
\}
\]

This cube can be visualized as having 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces.

### Conclusion

Multidimensional systems extend traditional systems theory to multiple independent variables, enabling the analysis and design of complex systems in fields like digital signal processing, medical imaging, and communications. Understanding the mathematical foundations of m-D systems, including state-space models and transfer functions, is crucial for developing advanced computational techniques that can handle the complexity of multidimensional data.

## Multidimensional Arrays in C

### Introduction
A **multidimensional array** in C is essentially an array of arrays, allowing you to store data in a tabular form, where each dimension represents a different layer of the array. This structure is particularly useful for representing data that naturally exists in more than one dimension, such as matrices (2D arrays) or grids of points in three-dimensional space (3D arrays). 

In memory, data in multidimensional arrays is typically stored in **row-major order**, which means that the elements of each row are stored contiguously in memory, followed by the elements of the next row, and so on.

### Declaring Multidimensional Arrays
The general syntax for declaring an N-dimensional array is:

```c
data_type array_name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];
```

- **data_type**: The type of data that will be stored in the array (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`).
- **array_name**: The name you assign to the array.
- **size1, size2, ..., sizeN**: The size of each dimension, representing the number of elements along each dimension.

#### Examples:
- **Two-dimensional array**: 
  ```c
  int two_d[10][20];
  ```
  This array can be visualized as a table with 10 rows and 20 columns.

- **Three-dimensional array**:
  ```c
  int three_d[10][20][30];
  ```
  This array can be visualized as a cube or a series of 2D arrays stacked on top of each other.

### Size of Multidimensional Arrays
The total number of elements that can be stored in a multidimensional array is calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions.

- For example, the array `int x[10][20]` can store `10 * 20 = 200` elements.
- Similarly, the array `int x[5][10][20]` can store `5 * 10 * 20 = 1000` elements.

To calculate the total size of a multidimensional array in bytes, you multiply the number of elements by the size of a single element (in bytes).

- For `int x[10][20]`, the size in bytes is `10 * 20 * 4 = 800 bytes` (assuming `int` is 4 bytes).
- For `int x[5][10][20]`, the size in bytes is `5 * 10 * 20 * 4 = 4000 bytes`.

### Common Forms of Multidimensional Arrays

#### Two-Dimensional Arrays
A **two-dimensional array (2D array)** is the simplest form of a multidimensional array. It can be visualized as a matrix with `x` rows and `y` columns. Each element in this array is identified by two indices: the row index and the column index.

**Declaration:**
```c
int array_name[x][y];
```
- **x**: Number of rows.
- **y**: Number of columns.

**Example:**
```c
int x[10][20];
```
This array has 10 rows and 20 columns.

### Initialization of Two-Dimensional Arrays

There are multiple ways to initialize a 2D array in C:

#### 1. Using an Initializer List
You can initialize a 2D array with a list of values enclosed in curly braces `{}`. There are two common methods:

**First Method:**
```c
int x[3][4] = {0, 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11};
```
Here, the values are filled row by row. The first 4 elements go into the first row, the next 4 into the second row, and so on.

**Second Method (Preferred):**
```c
int x[3][4] = {{0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, {8, 9, 10, 11}};
```
This method uses nested braces, where each set of braces represents a row. This approach is more readable and easier to understand.

**Note:** If you use list initialization without specifying the number of rows, the compiler can deduce the size of the array based on the initializer list:
```c
int x[][4] = {{0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, {8, 9, 10, 11}};
```

#### 2. Using Loops
You can also initialize a 2D array using loops, which is especially useful when the values have a sequential or patterned relationship.

**Example:**
```c
int x[3][4];

for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        x[i][j] = i + j;
    }
}
```
In this example, each element of the array is assigned a value equal to the sum of its row and column indices.

### Accessing Elements of Two-Dimensional Arrays
To access an element in a 2D array, you use its row and column indices:

**Syntax:**
```c
array_name[i][j];
```
- **i**: Row index.
- **j**: Column index.

**Example:**
```c
int element = x[2][1];
```
This accesses the element in the third row and second column (remember, indices start at 0).

### Traversing a Two-Dimensional Array
To traverse a 2D array, nested loops are typically used. You can traverse in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom) or column-major order (top to bottom, left to right).

**Example (Row-Major Order):**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int x[3][2] = { {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5} };

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            printf("Element at x[%i][%i]: %d\n", i, j, x[i][j]);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Element at x[0][0]: 0
Element at x[0][1]: 1
Element at x[1][0]: 2
Element at x[1][1]: 3
Element at x[2][0]: 4
Element at x[2][1]: 5
```

### Real-World Example: Image Processing

In **image processing**, a grayscale image can be represented as a 2D array where each element stores the intensity value of a pixel. For example:
```c
int image[256][256];
```
This array represents a 256x256 pixel image. Operations like **filtering**, **edge detection**, or **blurring** can be performed by manipulating this 2D array.

### Conclusion
Multidimensional arrays in C are powerful structures that allow for the representation of data in multiple dimensions. They are particularly useful in applications like scientific computing, graphics, and image processing. By understanding how to declare, initialize, and access these arrays, you can effectively manage and manipulate complex data sets.
### How 2D Arrays are Stored in Memory

2D arrays in C are stored contiguously in memory because computer memory is linear and cannot directly accommodate the two-dimensional structure. Therefore, the elements of a 2D array need to be "linearized" to be stored effectively. There are two common ways to linearize a 2D array:

1. **Row-major order**: In this method, the elements of the array are stored row by row. The first row is stored first, followed by the second row, and so on. This means that elements in the same row are adjacent in memory.

   - For example, consider a 2D array `int x[3][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};`
   - In row-major order, the memory layout would be: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

2. **Column-major order**: In this method, the elements of the array are stored column by column. The first column is stored first, followed by the second column, and so on. This means that elements in the same column are adjacent in memory.

   - For the same 2D array `int x[3][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};`
   - In column-major order, the memory layout would be: `1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9`.

#### Address Calculation
The computer does not store the addresses of all the elements of the array. Instead, it stores the **Base Address** (the address of the first element) and computes the address of any other element as needed. The formula for calculating the address of an element in a 2D array stored in row-major order is:

**Address of x[i][j] = Base Address + ((i * number_of_columns) + j) * size_of_data_type**

For column-major order, the formula would be:

**Address of x[i][j] = Base Address + ((j * number_of_rows) + i) * size_of_data_type**

### Three-Dimensional Array in C

A **three-dimensional array (3D array)** in C is an array of two-dimensional arrays. It can be visualized as multiple 2D arrays stacked on top of each other, forming a cube-like structure.

#### Declaration of 3D Arrays
The general syntax for declaring a 3D array is:

```c
data_type array_name[x][y][z];
```
- **data_type**: Type of data stored in the array (e.g., `int`, `float`).
- **array_name**: The name of the array.
- **x**: Number of 2D arrays.
- **y**: Number of rows in each 2D array.
- **z**: Number of columns in each 2D array.

**Example:**
```c
int array[3][3][3];
```
This declares a 3D array with 3 layers, each containing a 3x3 grid.

#### Initialization of 3D Arrays

Initialization of 3D arrays is similar to 2D arrays, but with an additional level of nesting:

**Using Initializer List:**

- **Method 1:**
  ```c
  int x[2][3][4] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
                    12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23};
  ```

- **Method 2 (Better):**
  ```c
  int x[2][3][4] = {
                      { {0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, {8, 9, 10, 11} },
                      { {12, 13, 14, 15}, {16, 17, 18, 19}, {20, 21, 22, 23} }
                   };
  ```

In Method 2, each set of braces represents a 2D array within the 3D array, making the structure clearer and easier to visualize.

#### Using Loops:
3D arrays can also be initialized using nested loops:

```c
int x[2][3][4];
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            x[i][j][k] = (some_value);
        }
    }
}
```
This method is useful when initializing arrays with a specific pattern or formula.

### Accessing Elements in 3D Arrays
Accessing elements in a 3D array is similar to accessing elements in a 2D array but with an additional index:

**Syntax:**
```c
array_name[x][y][z];
```
- **x**: Index of the 2D array.
- **y**: Row index within the selected 2D array.
- **z**: Column index within the selected row of the 2D array.

**Example:**
```c
int x[2][3][2] = {{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}, 
                  {{6, 7}, {8, 9}, {10, 11}}};

for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
        for (int k = 0; k < 2; ++k) {
            printf("Element at x[%i][%i][%i] = %d\n", i, j, k, x[i][j][k]);
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Element at x[0][0][0] = 0
Element at x[0][0][1] = 1
Element at x[0][1][0] = 2
Element at x[0][1][1] = 3
Element at x[0][2][0] = 4
Element at x[0][2][1] = 5
Element at x[1][0][0] = 6
Element at x[1][0][1] = 7
Element at x[1][1][0] = 8
Element at x[1][1][1] = 9
Element at x[1][2][0] = 10
Element at x[1][2][1] = 11
```

### Conclusion
Multidimensional arrays, including 2D and 3D arrays, are powerful tools for managing and manipulating complex data in C. While 2D arrays are commonly used for matrix operations, 3D arrays can be used for representing 3D spaces or time-sequenced data. Understanding how these arrays are stored and accessed in memory is crucial for efficient programming.
