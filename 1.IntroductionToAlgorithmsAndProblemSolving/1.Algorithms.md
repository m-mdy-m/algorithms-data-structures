# What is the algorithm?

## Introduction to Algorithms Book :

Informally:
A defined calculation method (completely defined) that takes a long time to take a value from the input and produce a value!

So the algorithm is a sequence of calculations
Steps that convert input into output

It can also be said that the algorithm is a tool for solving calculations!

> (that is, both a calculation method and a tool for calculation)

### Problem
The problem can be said that =>

Input/output relationship with problem instances and arbitrary size

In general, algorithms provide a specific computational method to establish the relationship between inputs and outputs for all types of problems. 


### example :
For example, think that we have to arrange a sequence of numbers uniformly!

Here is how we formally define the sorting problem:

Input: A sequence of n numbers(a1,a2,.....,an).

Output: A permutation (reordering) (a1,a2,......,an) of the input sequence such

that a1 <= a2 <= .... a`n.

Thus, given the input sequence (31,41,59,26,41,58) a correct sorting algorithm

returns as output the sequence (26,31,41,41,58,59) Such an input sequence is called an instance of the sorting problem

(It might be confusing, but we take the jumbled input and give the sorted output from small to large)


### **Choosing the Right Algorithm:**
The best algorithm for a specific task depends on various factors such as the number of items to be sorted, the degree to which they are already sorted, any restrictions on the values of the items, the computer's architecture, and the storage devices being used (like main memory, disks, or tapes).


### **Correctness of Algorithms:**
- An algorithm is considered correct if, for every input provided, it finishes its computation within a finite amount of time and produces the correct solution.
- A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem accurately. 

> . However, incorrect algorithms may not finish running at all on certain inputs, or they might produce incorrect results. Sometimes, though, incorrect algorithms can still be useful, especially if you can control their error rate.

### What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?

Practical applications of algorithms are everywhere and include the following:

- The Human Genome Project is working to identify all human genes and decode the sequences in human DNA. This involves using advanced algorithms to store and analyze genetic data efficiently. Techniques like dynamic programming help solve biological problems, especially those related to DNA sequence similarities. These algorithms save time and money, allowing scientists to extract more information from their experiments.

- The internet allows people worldwide to access vast amounts of information quickly. Clever algorithms help websites manage and process this data efficiently. Examples of problems where algorithms play a crucial role include finding optimal data routes and using search engines to locate specific information on web pages


- Electronic commerce allows for the electronic negotiation and exchange of goods and services. It relies on the privacy and security of personal information like credit card numbers, passwords, and bank statements. The key technologies used in electronic commerce include public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which are based on numerical algorithms and number theory (discussed in Chapter 31). These technologies help ensure the security of transactions and protect sensitive information during online exchanges.


- Manufacturing and commercial enterprises often face the challenge of allocating limited resources effectively. For example:
  - An oil company may need to decide where to place wells to maximize profits.
  - A political candidate may want to spend campaign funds strategically to increase their chances of winning an election.
  - Airlines need to assign crews to flights efficiently, ensuring coverage while meeting regulatory requirements.
  - Internet service providers may need to decide where to allocate resources to better serve their customers.
> These are all examples of problems that require optimization, where algorithms can help find the most beneficial solutions.


### We also demonstrate how to solve many specific problems, including the following:

- You have a road map with distances between intersections marked, and you want to find the shortest route from one intersection to another. With countless possible routes, how do you determine the shortest one? You can start by modeling the road map as a graph, where intersections are vertices and roads are edges. Then, you can use algorithms to find the shortest path from one vertex (intersection) to another. Chapter 22 explains how to efficiently solve this problem.


#### **These lists of algorithmic problems, though not exhaustive, share two common characteristics:**

1. **Many Candidate Solutions:** These problems typically have numerous possible solutions, but the vast majority of them do not actually solve the problem. Finding the best or optimal solution without explicitly examining every possibility can be quite challenging.

2. **Practical Applications:** The problems listed often have practical applications in various fields. For example, finding the shortest path in transportation networks has financial implications for companies like trucking or railroad firms, as shorter paths result in lower costs. Similarly, routing nodes on the internet need to find the shortest path to route messages quickly, and individuals use navigation apps to find driving directions efficiently.

While not every algorithmic problem has a readily identifiable set of candidate solutions, there are still practical applications. For instance, the discrete Fourier transform, which converts signals from the time domain to the frequency domain, plays a crucial role in signal processing, data compression, and other fields.


### Exercises

**Sorting Example:** 
Real-world Example: Online Retail Inventory
- Sorting is essential for managing the inventory of an online retail store. Items need to be organized based on various criteria such as category, popularity, or price. This ensures efficient search, quick access to relevant items, and a better user experience for customers.

**Shortest Distance Example:** 
Real-world Example: GPS Navigation
- Finding the shortest distance between two points is crucial in GPS navigation systems. The system needs to calculate the optimal route for a user to travel from their current location to a destination efficiently, minimizing time and fuel consumption.

1.1-2
Other measures of efficiency in a real-world setting might include:
- **Memory Usage:** How much memory does the algorithm or program consume?
- **Energy Consumption:** For mobile devices or battery-powered systems, minimizing energy usage is critical.
- **Scalability:** How well does the algorithm perform as the size of the input or problem increases?
- **Robustness:** How well does the algorithm handle unexpected or erroneous inputs?

**Data Structure Example: Hash Table**
Strengths:
- Efficient for quick data retrieval with a constant time complexity for average cases.
- Ideal for scenarios where key-value pairs need to be stored and quickly accessed.
- Well-suited for applications like hash-based caches and database indexing.

Limitations:
- May have collisions (two keys hashing to the same index), which requires additional handling like chaining or open addressing.
- May have a higher memory overhead due to potential unused slots.
- Not suitable if the order of elements is essential.

1.1-4
**Similarities between Shortest-Path and Traveling-Salesperson Problems:**
- Both are optimization problems seeking to find the most efficient route.
- They involve graphs where nodes represent locations and edges represent connections or distances.
- Both aim to minimize a certain metric (distance or cost).

**Differences between Shortest-Path and Traveling-Salesperson Problems:**
- The shortest-path problem seeks the minimum distance between two specific points, while the traveling-salesperson problem aims to find the shortest overall tour that visits all points once and returns to the starting point.
- The traveling-salesperson problem is NP-complete, making it generally harder to solve for larger instances.

- When designing aircraft, engineers need to find the optimal configuration for fuel efficiency, speed, and safety. Only the best solution will ensure the aircraft's performance and safety standards.

**Approximately the Best Solution Example:** 
Real-world Example: Resource Scheduling in Manufacturing
- In manufacturing, scheduling resources optimally is crucial. While achieving the absolute best schedule might be computationally expensive, an approximate solution that minimizes downtime and maximizes efficiency is often acceptable.

**Real-world Problem with Varied Input Availability:**
Real-world Example: Stock Market Analysis
- In stock market analysis, historical data may be available for analysis, allowing for comprehensive studies. However, real-time stock prices and market updates arrive continuously. Decision-making might involve a mix of pre-analyzed historical data and ongoing real-time information, making it an example of a problem with variable input availability.
