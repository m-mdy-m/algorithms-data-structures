# What is the algorithm?

## Introduction to Algorithms Book :

Informally:
A defined calculation method (completely defined) that takes a long time to take a value from the input and produce a value!

So the algorithm is a sequence of calculations
Steps that convert input into output

It can also be said that the algorithm is a tool for solving calculations!

> (that is, both a calculation method and a tool for calculation)

### problem
The problem can be said that =>

Input/output relationship with problem instances and arbitrary size

In general, algorithms provide a specific computational method to establish the relationship between inputs and outputs for all types of problems. 


### example :
For example, think that we have to arrange a sequence of numbers uniformly!

Here is how we formally define the sorting problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers(a1,a2,.....,an).
Output: A permutation (reordering) (a`1,a`2,......,a`n) of the input sequence such
that a`1 <= a`2 <= .... a`n.
Thus, given the input sequence (31,41,59,26,41,58) a correct sorting algorithm
returns as output the sequence (26,31,41,41,58,59) Such an input sequence is called an instance of the sorting problem

(It might be confusing, but we take the jumbled input and give the sorted output from small to large)


### **Choosing the Right Algorithm:**
The best algorithm for a specific task depends on various factors such as the number of items to be sorted, the degree to which they are already sorted, any restrictions on the values of the items, the computer's architecture, and the storage devices being used (like main memory, disks, or tapes).


### **Correctness of Algorithms:**
- An algorithm is considered correct if, for every input provided, it finishes its computation within a finite amount of time and produces the correct solution.
- A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem accurately. 

> . However, incorrect algorithms may not finish running at all on certain inputs, or they might produce incorrect results. Sometimes, though, incorrect algorithms can still be useful, especially if you can control their error rate.
