# What is the algorithm?

## Introduction to Algorithms Book :

Informally:
A defined calculation method (completely defined) that takes a long time to take a value from the input and produce a value!

So the algorithm is a sequence of calculations
Steps that convert input into output

It can also be said that the algorithm is a tool for solving calculations!

> (that is, both a calculation method and a tool for calculation)

### problem
The problem can be said that =>

Input/output relationship with problem instances and arbitrary size

In general, algorithms provide a specific computational method to establish the relationship between inputs and outputs for all types of problems. 


### example :
For example, think that we have to arrange a sequence of numbers uniformly!

Here is how we formally define the sorting problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers(a1,a2,.....,an).
Output: A permutation (reordering) (a`1,a`2,......,a`n) of the input sequence such
that a`1 <= a`2 <= .... a`n.
Thus, given the input sequence (31,41,59,26,41,58) a correct sorting algorithm
returns as output the sequence (26,31,41,41,58,59) Such an input sequence is called an instance of the sorting problem

(It might be confusing, but we take the jumbled input and give the sorted output from small to large)
