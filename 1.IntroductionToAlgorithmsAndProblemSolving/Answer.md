# Answer Exercises

## Answer One

Algorithm method or tool or sum of calculations with commands to do one thing!

## Answer Two

In our daily life:
Like making a house! We need a lot of tools and people to work with those tools and equipment to make or build a house!
So we can say this is an algorithm
This way => First, we estimate the initial cost of the house => Calculate the cost of purchasing equipment => Calculate the cost of each person's salary and the number of people we need, such as workers, buildings, draftsmen, etc. => Purchase of building materials and tools = > Coordinating people like the worker with the builder, coordinating the architect and the builder to make a strong house => estimation of additional costs => after completing the steps of building a house!

It may be a long process, but it can be said that this is an algorithm

For example => house building algorithm!

1. **Estimate initial cost:** Assessing the budget required for the project.
2. **Calculate equipment costs:** Determining the cost of purchasing necessary tools and equipment.
3. **Calculate labor costs:** Estimating the cost of hiring and compensating workers.
4. **Purchase materials:** Acquiring the necessary building materials and tools.
5. **Coordinate work:** Organizing and managing the tasks of different workers and professionals involved in the construction process, such as architects, builders, and contractors.
6. **Estimate additional costs:** Considering any unforeseen expenses or changes during the construction phase.
7. **Completion:** Concluding the construction process once all steps are completed satisfactorily.

## Answer there

It depends on your living environment!
In my life environment, for example, I say to start coding!

1. **Waking up:** Beginning the day by getting out of bed.
2. **Eating breakfast:** Providing energy and nourishment to start the day.
3. **Turning on the computer:** Preparing the necessary equipment for coding.
4. **Reviewing tasks:** Assessing what needs to be accomplished today, setting priorities.
5. **Getting started:** Engaging in the coding task or other work, effectively initiating productivity for the day.

> I must say that the algorithm must not be complicated, it might even be like this for you

1. Waking up (start)
2. Start coding (end)

## Answer Four

Let's explain this algorithm as an example:

The work of a school principal!

Imagine that a school principal is looking for a name, for example, Ali Mohammadi

Well, as usual in all their schools, they open the list of school students in alphabetical order and look for him or search his name on the computer or website and whatever.

Well, now think that the list was not sorted alphabetically and it was messed up! At that time, the school principal had to spend days or even months to find a name

## Answer Five

This exercise is like the example of building a building or a house, and the complexity of building a house in the first example depends on several reasons, the complexity of an algorithm.

1. **Size of the land:** The size of the land can affect the complexity of the construction project. A larger land area may require more materials, labor, and time to complete the construction, increasing the complexity of the algorithm for planning and executing the project efficiently.

2. **Expenses:** The budget or expenses allocated for building the house influence the complexity of decision-making processes. If there are strict budget constraints, the algorithm for selecting materials, hiring labor, and managing resources needs to be optimized to ensure cost-effectiveness without compromising quality.

3. **Map of the building:** The architectural design or blueprint of the house provides a structured plan for construction. The complexity of the blueprint, including the number of rooms, floors, intricate designs, etc., affects the complexity of the construction algorithm. More complex designs may require specialized skills, materials, and construction techniques, impacting efficiency.

4. **Equipment and tools:** The availability and selection of equipment and tools impact the efficiency of construction. Using appropriate tools and machinery can streamline the construction process, while inadequate or inefficient tools may slow down progress and increase complexity.

5. **Speed of construction and workers:** The pace at which the construction progresses depends on the efficiency and skill of the workers, as well as external factors like weather conditions. Optimizing the workflow and coordinating tasks among workers contribute to the efficiency of the algorithm for building the house.

6. **Additional costs:** Unexpected expenses or changes during the construction process add complexity to the algorithm for managing the project. Adapting to unforeseen circumstances while staying within budget requires careful planning and decision-making.

### Answer Six

To answer this question, let's think that we want to make a dish and take help from a book that explains the steps of food preparation.

We say to our mother:
Mom, don't cook for dinner! I will do this!
You proceed according to the steps or algorithms written in that book and at the end you put the food on the gas until it is ready and after 20 minutes (according to the book) you take the food and eat it.
When you take the food, the food is burnt!

**Why do you think it burned?**

Because you didn't read the book properly due to too much excitement and you didn't get help from other sources for the correctness of the book (for example, you say to your mother: Mom, is the recipe for this dish correct?)

With this mistake and loss of food, your mother gets nervous and you end up sleeping on the street at nightðŸ˜‚
> Here's why correctness is important:

1. **Quality of Results:** A correct algorithm ensures that the desired outcome is achieved. In cooking, following the correct recipe results in a delicious and well-prepared dish. Incorrect algorithms, on the other hand, can lead to subpar or undesirable results.

2. **Safety:** In some cases, incorrect algorithms can pose safety risks. For instance, if a cooking recipe fails to mention proper food handling or cooking temperatures, it could lead to foodborne illnesses or kitchen accidents.

3. **Time and Resources:** While it may take longer to execute a correct algorithm, it ultimately saves time and resources in the long run by avoiding mistakes, rework, or wastage. In the example of cooking, redoing a burnt dish consumes additional time and ingredients.

4. **Trust and Reliability:** Using correct algorithms builds trust and reliability in the process. If people know they can rely on the algorithm to produce accurate results, they are more likely to use it and have confidence in its outcomes.

5. **Avoiding Negative Consequences:** Incorrect algorithms can have negative consequences beyond the immediate task at hand. In your example, burning the food not only ruins dinner but also causes stress and potentially strained relationships with family members.
