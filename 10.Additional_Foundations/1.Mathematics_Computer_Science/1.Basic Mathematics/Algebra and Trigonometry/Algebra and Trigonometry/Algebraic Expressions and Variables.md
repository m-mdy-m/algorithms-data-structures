### Algebraic Expressions and Variables

**Understanding Variables:**

In algebra, a variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for a number. Variables allow us to write general expressions that can represent many different situations.

**Better Example from the Real World:**

Consider a taxi fare calculation:
- The taxi company charges a base fare of $3 plus $2 per mile driven.
- Let $x$ represent the number of miles driven.

The total fare $F$ can be expressed as:
$F = 3 + 2x$

Here:
- $3$ is the base fare.
- $2x$ represents the additional fare, where $2$ (dollars per mile) is multiplied by $x$ (the number of miles).

### Algebraic Expressions

An algebraic expression combines variables and constants (fixed numbers) using operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers (exponents), or roots.

**Examples:**

1. **Addition and Subtraction:**
   - $x + 6$: This represents a number $x$ increased by 6.
   - $x - 6$: This represents a number $x$ decreased by 6.

2. **Multiplication:**
   - $6x$: This means 6 times the number $x$.

3. **Division:**
   - $\frac{x}{6}$: This represents the number $x$ divided by 6.

4. **Combining Operations:**
   - $3x + 5$: This means 3 times $x$ plus 5.
   - $x^2 - 3$: This represents $x$ squared (multiplied by itself) minus 3.

### Exponents and Exponential Notation

An exponent indicates how many times a number (the base) is multiplied by itself. Exponential notation is a way to express this repeated multiplication compactly.

**Definition:**
If $n$ is a positive integer, $b^n$ (read as "b to the nth power") means:
$b^n = b \times b \times b \times \cdots \times b$
(where $b$ is multiplied by itself $n$ times).

**Properties:**
- $b^1 = b$ (any number to the power of 1 is the number itself)
- $b^0 = 1$ (any number to the power of 0 is 1, for $b \neq 0$)

**Real-World Example of Exponential Notation:**

**Compound Interest:**

Imagine you invest $1000 in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. If the interest is compounded yearly, the amount of money $A$ in the account after $t$ years can be calculated using the formula:
$A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$

Where:
- $P$ is the principal amount ($1000).
- $r$ is the annual interest rate (0.05 or 5%).
- $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (1 for yearly).
- $t$ is the number of years.

For yearly compounding:
$A = 1000 \left(1 + 0.05\right)^t$

If you want to know the amount after 3 years:
$A = 1000 \left(1.05\right)^3$

Calculate:
$1.05^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.157625$
$A = 1000 \times 1.157625 = 1157.63$

After 3 years, the amount in the account would be $1157.63.

This example shows how exponential notation helps in calculating the growth of investments over time due to compound interest.

### Summary

Algebraic expressions and exponential notation are powerful tools for modeling and solving real-world problems. Variables allow us to create general formulas, while exponents help us manage repeated multiplication in a concise way. By understanding these concepts, we can better analyze situations like taxi fares or investment growth.
