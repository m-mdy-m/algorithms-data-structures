### Algebraic Expressions and Variables

Algebra involves using letters to represent numbers. These letters are called variables because they can represent different numbers in different situations.

**Example:**
Imagine you're at the beach. Letâ€™s say $x$ represents the number of minutes you can stay in the sun without getting sunburned if you're not wearing sunscreen. If you wear sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 6, you can stay in the sun six times longer without getting burned. We can represent this increased exposure time as $6x$. Here, 6 is multiplied by $x$. 

In algebra, placing a number and a letter next to each other, like in $6x$, means they are multiplied together. 

### Algebraic Expressions

An algebraic expression is a combination of numbers and variables using mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers (exponents), or roots. Here are some examples:

- $x + 6$ (x plus 6)
- $x - 6$ (x minus 6)
- $6x$ (6 times x)
- $\frac{x}{6}$ (x divided by 6)
- $3x + 5$ (3 times x plus 5)
- $x^2 - 3$ (x squared minus 3)
- $7 + x$ (7 plus x)

### Exponents and Exponential Notation

Many algebraic expressions involve exponents. An exponent indicates how many times a number (called the base) is multiplied by itself.

**Example:**
The expression $4x^2 + 341x + 3194$ can represent the average cost of tuition and fees at public U.S. colleges for the school year ending $x$ years after 2000. 

In this expression:
- $x^2$ means $x$ multiplied by itself ($x \times x$), which is read as "x squared."

### Exponential Notation

Exponential notation is a way to express repeated multiplication of the same number.

If $n$ is a counting number (1, 2, 3, etc.), then:
$b^n = b \times b \times b \times \cdots \times b$
(where $b$ is used as a factor $n$ times).

This is read as "the nth power of $b$" or "$b$ to the nth power."

### Examples of Exponential Notation

- $8^2 = 8 \times 8 = 64$ (8 squared)
- $5^3 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$ (5 cubed)
- $2^4 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$ (2 to the fourth power)

In exponential notation:
- $b^1 = b$ (any number to the power of 1 is the number itself)

By using algebraic expressions and exponential notation, we can represent complex mathematical ideas in a concise and clear way.
