#### Evaluating Algebraic Expressions

Evaluating an algebraic expression means finding its value for specific values of the variables within it. Many algebraic expressions involve multiple operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents). To evaluate them correctly without a calculator, you must follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

1. **P**arentheses
2. **E**xponents
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

### Order of Operations Agreement

1. **Parentheses:** 
   - Perform all operations inside the innermost parentheses first and then work outward.
   - If the expression includes a fraction, treat the numerator (top part) and the denominator (bottom part) as if each is enclosed in parentheses.

2. **Exponents:**
   - Evaluate all exponential expressions next.

3. **Multiplication and Division:**
   - Perform these operations as they appear from left to right.

4. **Addition and Subtraction:**
   - Finally, perform these operations as they appear from left to right.

### Example: Evaluating an Algebraic Expression

**Problem:**
Evaluate $7 + 5(x - 4)^3$ for $x = 6$.

**Solution:**

1. **Substitute the given value of $x$:**

   Replace $x$ with 6 in the expression:
   $7 + 5(6 - 4)^3$

2. **Evaluate inside the parentheses:**

   Perform the subtraction inside the parentheses:
   $7 + 5(2)^3$
   (Here, $6 - 4 = 2$)

3. **Evaluate the exponent:**

   Calculate the cube of 2 (which is $2 \times 2 \times 2$):
   $7 + 5(8)$
   (Here, $2^3 = 8$)

4. **Perform the multiplication:**

   Multiply 5 by 8:
   $7 + 40$
   (Here, $5 \times 8 = 40$)

5. **Perform the addition:**

   Add 7 and 40:
   $47$

So, the value of the expression $7 + 5(x - 4)^3$ for $x = 6$ is 47.

### Check Point

Now, letâ€™s evaluate a similar expression:

**Problem:**
Evaluate $8 + 6(x - 3)^2$ for $x = 13$.

**Solution:**

1. **Substitute the given value of $x$:**

   Replace $x$ with 13 in the expression:
   $8 + 6(13 - 3)^2$

2. **Evaluate inside the parentheses:**

   Perform the subtraction inside the parentheses:
   $8 + 6(10)^2$
   (Here, $13 - 3 = 10$)

3. **Evaluate the exponent:**

   Calculate the square of 10 (which is $10 \times 10$):
   $8 + 6(100)$
   (Here, $10^2 = 100$)

4. **Perform the multiplication:**

   Multiply 6 by 100:
   $8 + 600$
   (Here, $6 \times 100 = 600$)

5. **Perform the addition:**

   Add 8 and 600:
   $608$

So, the value of the expression $8 + 6(x - 3)^2$ for $x = 13$ is 608.

By following these steps carefully and adhering to the order of operations, you can accurately evaluate algebraic expressions for any given value of the variable.
