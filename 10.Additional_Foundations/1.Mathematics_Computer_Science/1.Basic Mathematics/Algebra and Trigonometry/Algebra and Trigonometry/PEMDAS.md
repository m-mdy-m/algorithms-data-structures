### PEMDAS Rule Explained

**PEMDAS** stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. It is a mnemonic device used to remember the order of operations for solving arithmetic problems effectively.

### What is PEMDAS Rule?
The PEMDAS rule is a sequence of operations that tells us the correct order to solve a mathematical expression. This ensures that everyone solves the problem in the same way and gets the same result. 

### PEMDAS Definition
PEMDAS is an acronym representing the sequence of operations:

- **P**arentheses: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.
- **E**xponents: Evaluate exponents (powers and roots, like squares and square roots).
- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision: Perform these operations next, moving from left to right.
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction: Finally, perform these operations, moving from left to right.

### Full Form of PEMDAS
PEMDAS is a set of rules that helps solve mathematical problems in the correct order. It's like a recipe for solving equations:

- **P** stands for Parentheses: First, solve whatever is inside parentheses.
- **E** stands for Exponents: Then solve exponents (numbers raised to a power).
- **MD** stands for Multiplication and Division: Do these next, from left to right.
- **AS** stands for Addition and Subtraction: Lastly, perform these operations from left to right.

### Example: Using PEMDAS to Solve an Expression

**Problem:** Simplify $5 + 2[10 - 3(4 - 2)] ÷ 2$

1. **Parentheses:** Solve inside the innermost parentheses first:
   $4 - 2 = 2$
   Now the expression is $5 + 2[10 - 3(2)] ÷ 2$.

2. **Parentheses:** Solve the next set of parentheses:
   $3 \times 2 = 6$
   Now the expression is $5 + 2[10 - 6] ÷ 2$.

3. **Parentheses:** Continue solving inside the brackets:
   $10 - 6 = 4$
   Now the expression is $5 + 2[4] ÷ 2$.

4. **Multiplication:** Solve the multiplication inside the brackets:
   $2 \times 4 = 8$
   Now the expression is $5 + 8 ÷ 2$.

5. **Division:** Perform the division:
   $8 ÷ 2 = 4$
   Now the expression is $5 + 4$.

6. **Addition:** Finally, add the numbers:
   $5 + 4 = 9$

So, $5 + 2[10 - 3(4 - 2)] ÷ 2 = 9$.

### PEMDAS vs BODMAS

PEMDAS is very similar to BODMAS, which is another acronym used to remember the order of operations. The only difference is in terminology:
- **PEMDAS:** Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
- **BODMAS:** Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

Despite the different terms, both acronyms ensure that calculations are performed in a specific and consistent order.

### Applications of PEMDAS

Understanding PEMDAS is crucial for various fields:

- **Engineering:** Ensures correct calculations in designing structures, like calculating loads and stresses in bridges.
- **Computer Science:** Helps in writing correct algorithms, ensuring accurate results in programs.
- **Economics and Finance:** Used to calculate financial metrics, ensuring sound investment decisions.
- **Pharmacy:** Ensures correct medication dosages.
- **Architecture:** Ensures precise calculations in designing buildings.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Simplify $[18 + {12 - (4 \times 8)}]$

1. **Parentheses:** Solve inside the innermost parentheses first:
   $4 \times 8 = 32$
   Now the expression is $[18 + {12 - 32}]$.

2. **Parentheses:** Continue solving inside the brackets:
   $12 - 32 = -20$
   Now the expression is $[18 + (-20)]$.

3. **Addition:** Finally, add the numbers:
   $18 + (-20) = -2$

**Example 2:** Calculate $(14 + 2 \div 3 + 1) - 2$

1. **Parentheses:** Solve inside the parentheses first:
   $2 \div 3 = 0.6667$
   Now the expression is $(14 + 0.6667 + 1) - 2$.

2. **Addition:** Continue solving inside the parentheses:
   $14 + 0.6667 + 1 = 15.6667$
   Now the expression is $15.6667 - 2$.

3. **Subtraction:** Finally, subtract the numbers:
   $15.6667 - 2 = 13.6667$

### Practice Problems

1. **Solve:** $2 - 7 \div (6 - 2) \times 3 + 8$
2. **Solve:** $5 + 8 \times (2 + 3) \div 4 - 3$
3. **Simplify:** $15 \div (6 - 3 \times 4)$
4. **Calculate:** $[20 + {12 - (5 \times 8)}]$

### Conclusion

The PEMDAS rule is an essential guideline for solving math problems that involve multiple operations. By following PEMDAS, you ensure that you perform calculations in the correct order, avoiding mistakes and getting accurate results. This rule is crucial not only in academic settings but also in various professional fields where precise calculations are necessary.
