### Logic

**Definition:**
Logic is the foundation of all mathematical reasoning and automated reasoning. It involves the rules that define the meaning of mathematical statements, enabling us to understand and reason with these statements. For instance, the statement ∃x such that x = a² + b², where x, a, b ∈ ℤ means “There exists an integer that is the sum of two squares.”

### Importance of Mathematical Logic

Mathematical logic is crucial because it provides precise meaning to mathematical statements. It helps differentiate between valid and invalid mathematical arguments. In computer science, logic is fundamental, influencing the design of digital circuits, the creation of computer programs, and the verification of program correctness.

### Types of Propositions

**Propositional logic** deals with propositions, statements that can be true or false. These propositions are the building blocks of more complex logical statements.

#### Atomic Propositions
Atomic propositions are simple statements that cannot be broken down further. Example: "It is raining."

#### Compound Propositions
Compound propositions are formed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives. Example: "It is raining and it is Friday."

### Propositional Logic

Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic or statement logic, studies the ways of joining and modifying propositions to create more complex statements. It also examines the logical relationships and properties derived from these combinations. Classical truth-functional propositional logic focuses on logical operators and connectives to form statements whose truth values depend entirely on the truth values of their components. This logic assumes that every statement is either true or false, with no middle ground.

### Truth Table

A truth table lists all possible truth values of propositions combined by logical connectives. This helps determine the truth value of a proposition in all possible scenarios.

### Common Logical Connectives

1. **Negation (¬p)**: The negation of a proposition p is true when p is false, and false when p is true.
    - **Example**: If p is "It is raining," ¬p is "It is not raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | ¬p |
        |---|----|
        | T | F  |
        | F | T  |

2. **Conjunction (p ∧ q)**: The conjunction of propositions p and q is true only when both p and q are true.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ∧ q is "Today is Friday and it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ∧ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | F     |
        | F | T | F     |
        | F | F | F     |

3. **Disjunction (p ∨ q)**: The disjunction of propositions p and q is true when at least one of p or q is true.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ∨ q is "Today is Friday or it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ∨ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | T     |
        | F | T | T     |
        | F | F | F     |

4. **Exclusive Or (p ⊕ q)**: The exclusive or of propositions p and q is true when either p or q is true, but not both.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ⊕ q is "Either today is Friday or it is raining, but not both."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ⊕ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | F     |
        | T | F | T     |
        | F | T | T     |
        | F | F | F     |

5. **Implication (p → q)**: The implication p → q means "if p then q." It is false only when p is true and q is false.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p → q is "If today is Friday, then it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p → q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | F     |
        | F | T | T     |
        | F | F | T     |

6. **Biconditional (p ↔ q)**: The biconditional p ↔ q means "p if and only if q." It is true when p and q have the same truth values.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ↔ q is "Today is Friday if and only if it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ↔ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | F     |
        | F | T | F     |
        | F | F | T     |

### Example Exercise

**Consider the following statements:**
- P: Good mobile phones are not cheap.
- Q: Cheap mobile phones are not good.
- L: P implies Q
- M: Q implies P
- N: P is equivalent to Q

**Which one of the following about L, M, and N is CORRECT?**
(A) Only L is TRUE.  
(B) Only M is TRUE.  
(C) Only N is TRUE.  
(D) L, M, and N are TRUE.

**Solution:**
- **L**: P → Q ("If good mobile phones are not cheap, then cheap mobile phones are not good.") This is true because if good mobile phones are not cheap, it naturally follows that cheap mobile phones are not good.
- **M**: Q → P ("If cheap mobile phones are not good, then good mobile phones are not cheap.") This is also true because if cheap mobile phones are not good, it means good ones must be expensive.
- **N**: P ↔ Q ("Good mobile phones are not cheap if and only if cheap mobile phones are not good.") This is true because both statements express the same idea.

Thus, **D (L, M, and N are TRUE)** is correct.

**Additional Example:**
- **Real-World Example of Implication**: "If it rains, the ground will be wet." If it rains (p is true), then the ground is indeed wet (q is true). If it does not rain (p is false), we cannot infer anything about the ground's wetness based on this statement alone, so the implication holds true by default.

Understanding these logical principles is fundamental to reasoning in mathematics and computer science, where precise definitions and valid arguments are essential.
