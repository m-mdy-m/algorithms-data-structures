### Logic

**Definition:**
Logic is the foundation of all mathematical reasoning and automated reasoning. It involves the rules that define the meaning of mathematical statements, enabling us to understand and reason with these statements. For instance, the statement ∃x such that x = a² + b², where x, a, b ∈ ℤ means “There exists an integer that is the sum of two squares.”

### Importance of Mathematical Logic

Mathematical logic is crucial because it provides precise meaning to mathematical statements. It helps differentiate between valid and invalid mathematical arguments. In computer science, logic is fundamental, influencing the design of digital circuits, the creation of computer programs, and the verification of program correctness.

### Types of Propositions

**Propositional logic** deals with propositions, statements that can be true or false. These propositions are the building blocks of more complex logical statements.

#### Atomic Propositions
Atomic propositions are simple statements that cannot be broken down further. Example: "It is raining."

#### Compound Propositions
Compound propositions are formed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives. Example: "It is raining and it is Friday."

### Propositional Logic

Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic or statement logic, studies the ways of joining and modifying propositions to create more complex statements. It also examines the logical relationships and properties derived from these combinations. Classical truth-functional propositional logic focuses on logical operators and connectives to form statements whose truth values depend entirely on the truth values of their components. This logic assumes that every statement is either true or false, with no middle ground.

### Truth Table

A truth table lists all possible truth values of propositions combined by logical connectives. This helps determine the truth value of a proposition in all possible scenarios.

### Common Logical Connectives

1. **Negation (¬p)**: The negation of a proposition p is true when p is false, and false when p is true.
    - **Example**: If p is "It is raining," ¬p is "It is not raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | ¬p |
        |---|----|
        | T | F  |
        | F | T  |

2. **Conjunction (p ∧ q)**: The conjunction of propositions p and q is true only when both p and q are true.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ∧ q is "Today is Friday and it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ∧ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | F     |
        | F | T | F     |
        | F | F | F     |

3. **Disjunction (p ∨ q)**: The disjunction of propositions p and q is true when at least one of p or q is true.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ∨ q is "Today is Friday or it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ∨ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | T     |
        | F | T | T     |
        | F | F | F     |

4. **Exclusive Or (p ⊕ q)**: The exclusive or of propositions p and q is true when either p or q is true, but not both.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ⊕ q is "Either today is Friday or it is raining, but not both."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ⊕ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | F     |
        | T | F | T     |
        | F | T | T     |
        | F | F | F     |

5. **Implication (p → q)**: The implication p → q means "if p then q." It is false only when p is true and q is false.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p → q is "If today is Friday, then it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p → q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | F     |
        | F | T | T     |
        | F | F | T     |

6. **Biconditional (p ↔ q)**: The biconditional p ↔ q means "p if and only if q." It is true when p and q have the same truth values.
    - **Example**: If p is "Today is Friday" and q is "It is raining," p ↔ q is "Today is Friday if and only if it is raining."
    - **Truth Table**:
        | p | q | p ↔ q |
        |---|---|-------|
        | T | T | T     |
        | T | F | F     |
        | F | T | F     |
        | F | F | T     |

### Example Exercise

**Consider the following statements:**
- P: Good mobile phones are not cheap.
- Q: Cheap mobile phones are not good.
- L: P implies Q
- M: Q implies P
- N: P is equivalent to Q

**Which one of the following about L, M, and N is CORRECT?**
(A) Only L is TRUE.  
(B) Only M is TRUE.  
(C) Only N is TRUE.  
(D) L, M, and N are TRUE.

**Solution:**
- **L**: P → Q ("If good mobile phones are not cheap, then cheap mobile phones are not good.") This is true because if good mobile phones are not cheap, it naturally follows that cheap mobile phones are not good.
- **M**: Q → P ("If cheap mobile phones are not good, then good mobile phones are not cheap.") This is also true because if cheap mobile phones are not good, it means good ones must be expensive.
- **N**: P ↔ Q ("Good mobile phones are not cheap if and only if cheap mobile phones are not good.") This is true because both statements express the same idea.

Thus, **D (L, M, and N are TRUE)** is correct.

**Additional Example:**
- **Real-World Example of Implication**: "If it rains, the ground will be wet." If it rains (p is true), then the ground is indeed wet (q is true). If it does not rain (p is false), we cannot infer anything about the ground's wetness based on this statement alone, so the implication holds true by default.

### Propositions in Logic

Our discussion begins with an introduction to the basic building blocks of logic—propositions.

#### Definition of a Proposition

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence (a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both.

#### Examples of Propositions

**EXAMPLE 1**: All the following declarative sentences are propositions.

1. Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States of America.
2. Toronto is the capital of Canada.
3. 1 + 1 = 2.
4. 2 + 2 = 3.

Propositions 1 and 3 are true, whereas 2 and 4 are false.

#### Non-Propositions

Some sentences that are not propositions are given in **EXAMPLE 2**.

1. What time is it?
2. Read this carefully.
3. x + 1 = 2.
4. x + y = z.

Sentences 1 and 2 are not propositions because they are not declarative sentences. Sentences 3 and 4 are not propositions because they are neither true nor false until specific values are assigned to the variables. Note that each of sentences 3 and 4 can be turned into a proposition if we assign values to the variables. We will also discuss other ways to turn sentences such as these into propositions in Section 1.4.

### Propositional Variables

We use letters to denote propositional variables (or sentential variables), that is, variables that represent propositions, just as letters are used to denote numerical variables. The conventional letters used for propositional variables are $p, q, r, s, \ldots$. The truth value of a proposition is true, denoted by $T$, if it is a true proposition, and the truth value of a proposition is false, denoted by $F$, if it is a false proposition. Propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions are called **atomic propositions**.

### Propositional Logic

The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the **propositional calculus** or **propositional logic**. It was first developed systematically by the Greek philosopher Aristotle more than 2300 years ago.

We now turn our attention to methods for producing new propositions from those that we already have. These methods were discussed by the English mathematician George Boole in 1854 in his book *The Laws of Thought*. Many mathematical statements are constructed by combining one or more propositions. New propositions, called **compound propositions**, are formed from existing propositions using logical operators.

### Negation

**Definition 1**: Let $p$ be a proposition. The **negation** of $p$, denoted by $\neg p$ (also denoted by $\tilde{p}$), is the statement:
- “It is not the case that $p$.”

The proposition $\neg p$ is read “not $p$.” The truth value of the negation of $p$, $\neg p$, is the opposite of the truth value of $p$.

Remark: The notation for the negation operator is not standardized. Although $\neg p$ and $\tilde{p}$ are the most common notations used in mathematics to express the negation of $p$, other notations you might see are $\sim p$, $-p$, $p'$, $Np$, and $!p$.

#### Examples of Negation

**EXAMPLE 3**: Find the negation of the proposition “Michael’s PC runs Linux” and express this in simple English.

**Solution**: The negation is:
- “It is not the case that Michael’s PC runs Linux.”
This negation can be more simply expressed as:
- “Michael’s PC does not run Linux.”

**EXAMPLE 4**: Find the negation of the proposition “Vandana’s smartphone has at least 32 GB of memory” and express this in simple English.

**Solution**: The negation is:
- “It is not the case that Vandana’s smartphone has at least 32 GB of memory.”
This negation can also be expressed as:
- “Vandana’s smartphone does not have at least 32 GB of memory.”
Or even more simply as:
- “Vandana’s smartphone has less than 32 GB of memory.”

Table 1 displays the truth table for the negation of a proposition $p$. This table has a row for each of the two possible truth values of $p$. Each row shows the truth value of $\neg p$ corresponding to the truth value of $p$ for this row.

#### Truth Table for Negation

| $p$ | $\neg p$ |
|--------|-------------|
| T      | F           |
| F      | T           |

The negation of a proposition can also be considered the result of the operation of the negation operator on a proposition. The negation operator constructs a new proposition from a single existing proposition.

### Logical Operators (Connectives)

We will now introduce the logical operators that are used to form new propositions from two or more existing propositions. These logical operators are also called **connectives**.

### Conjunction

**Definition 2**: Let $p$ and $q$ be propositions. The **conjunction** of $p$ and $q$, denoted by $p \land q$, is the proposition:
- “$p$ and $q$.”

The conjunction $p \land q$ is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true and is false otherwise.

Table 2 displays the truth table of $p \land q$. This table has a row for each of the four possible combinations of truth values of $p$ and $q$. The four rows correspond to the pairs of truth values $TT, TF, FT,$ and $FF$, where the first truth value in the pair is the truth value of $p$ and the second truth value is the truth value of $q$.

Note that in logic the word “but” sometimes is used instead of “and” in a conjunction. For example, the statement “The sun is shining, but it is raining” is another way of saying “The sun is shining and it is raining.” (In natural language, there is a subtle difference in meaning between “and” and “but”; we will not be concerned with this nuance here.)

#### Example of Conjunction

**EXAMPLE 5**: Find the conjunction of the propositions $p$ and $q$ where $p$ is the proposition “Rebecca’s PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space” and $q$ is the proposition “The processor in Rebecca’s PC runs faster than 1 GHz.”

**Solution**: The conjunction of these propositions, $p \land q$, is the proposition:
- “Rebecca’s PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space, and the processor in Rebecca’s PC runs faster than 1 GHz.”

This conjunction can be expressed more simply as:
- “Rebecca’s PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space, and its processor runs faster than 1 GHz.”

For this conjunction to be true, both conditions given must be true. It is false when one or both of these conditions are false.

#### Truth Table for Conjunction

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| T      | T      | T               |
| T      | F      | F               |
| F      | T      | F               |
| F      | F      | F               |

### Disjunction

**Definition 3**: Let $p$ and $q$ be propositions. The **disjunction** of $p$ and $q$, denoted by $p \lor q$, is the proposition:
- “$p$ or $q$.”

The disjunction $p \lor q$ is false when both $p$ and $q$ are false and is true otherwise.

Table 3 displays the truth table for $p \lor q$.

The use of the connective "or" in a disjunction corresponds to one of the two ways the word "or" is used in English, namely, as an inclusive or. A disjunction is true when at least one of the two propositions is true. That is, $p \lor q$ is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true or when exactly one of $p$ and $q$ is true.

#### Examples of Disjunction

**EXAMPLE 6**: Translate the statement “Students who have taken calculus or introductory computer science can take this class” in a statement in propositional logic using the propositions $p$: “A student who has taken calculus can take this class” and $q$: “A student who has taken introductory computer science can take this class.”

**Solution**: We assume that this statement means that students who have taken both calculus and introductory computer science can take the class, as well as the students who have taken only one of the two subjects. Hence, this statement can be expressed as $p \lor q$, the inclusive or, or disjunction, of $p$ and $q$.

**EXAMPLE 7**: What is the disjunction of the propositions $p$ and $q$, where $p$ and $q$ are the same propositions as in Example 5?

**Solution**: The disjunction of $p$ and $q

$, $p \lor q$, is the proposition:
- “Rebecca’s PC has at least 16 GB free hard disk space, or the processor in Rebecca’s PC runs faster than 1 GHz.”

This proposition is true when Rebecca’s PC has at least 16 GB free hard disk space, when the PC’s processor runs faster than 1 GHz, and when both conditions are true. It is false when both of these conditions are false, that is, when Rebecca’s PC has less than 16 GB free hard disk space and the processor in her PC runs at 1 GHz or slower.

#### Truth Table for Disjunction

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \lor q$ |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| T      | T      | T              |
| T      | F      | T              |
| F      | T      | T              |
| F      | F      | F              |

### Exclusive Or (XOR)

Besides its use in disjunctions, the connective "or" is also used to express an **exclusive or**. Unlike the disjunction of two propositions $p$ and $q$, the exclusive or of these two propositions is true when exactly one of $p$ and $q$ is true; it is false when both $p$ and $q$ are true (and when both are false).

**Definition 4**: Let $p$ and $q$ be propositions. The **exclusive or** of $p$ and $q$, denoted by $p \oplus q$ (or $p \text{ XOR } q$), is the proposition that is true when exactly one of $p$ and $q$ is true and is false otherwise.

#### Examples of Exclusive Or

**EXAMPLE 8**: Let $p$ and $q$ be the propositions that state “A student can have a salad with dinner” and “A student can have soup with dinner,” respectively. What is $p \oplus q$, the exclusive or of $p$ and $q$?

**Solution**: The exclusive or of $p$ and $q$ is the statement that is true when exactly one of $p$ and $q$ is true. That is, $p \oplus q$ is the statement:
- “A student can have soup or salad, but not both, with dinner.”

Note that this is often stated as “A student can have soup or a salad with dinner,” without explicitly stating that taking both is not permitted.

**EXAMPLE 9**: Express the statement “I will use all my savings to travel to Europe or to buy an electric car” in propositional logic using the statement $p$: “I will use all my savings to travel to Europe” and the statement $q$: “I will use all my savings to buy an electric car.”

**Solution**: To translate this statement, we first note that the "or" in this statement must be an exclusive or because this student can either use all his or her savings to travel to Europe or use all these savings to buy an electric car, but cannot both go to Europe and buy an electric car. (This is clear because either option requires all his savings.) Hence, this statement can be expressed as $p \oplus q$.

#### Truth Table for Exclusive Or

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \oplus q$ |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| T      | T      | F                |
| T      | F      | T                |
| F      | T      | T                |
| F      | F      | F                |

### Real-World Example of Propositional Logic

Consider the real-world scenario of a home automation system:

1. **Proposition**: “The front door is locked.” (denoted by $p$)
2. **Proposition**: “The security system is armed.” (denoted by $q$)

- **Negation**: “The front door is not locked.” (denoted by $\neg p$)
- **Conjunction**: “The front door is locked, and the security system is armed.” (denoted by $p \land q$)
- **Disjunction**: “The front door is locked, or the security system is armed.” (denoted by $p \lor q$)
- **Exclusive Or**: “Either the front door is locked, or the security system is armed, but not both.” (denoted by $p \oplus q$)

In this example, the home automation system might take different actions based on the status of these propositions. If $p \land q$ is true, the system could ensure all lights are turned off. If $\neg p$ is true, it might send an alert to the homeowner. If $p \oplus q$ is true, it might log a security warning indicating that one but not both conditions are met, potentially signaling an incomplete security setup.
