## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of various data structures and algorithms, along with detailed explanations and use cases. The goal is to build a strong foundation in these essential concepts and prepare for more advanced topics.

## Basic Data Structures
### Array

#### Implementation
```python
# Dynamic array example in Python
class DynamicArray:
    def __init__(self):
        self.array = []
    
    def append(self, value):
        self.array.append(value)
    
    def get(self, index):
        if 0 <= index < len(self.array):
            return self.array[index]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
```

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Elements are stored contiguously, allowing O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index.
- **Advantages:** Fast access to elements, efficient memory usage.
- **Disadvantages:** Fixed size (for static arrays), costly resizing operations (for dynamic arrays).
- **Use Cases:** Storing a collection of items, implementing other data structures like stacks and queues.

### Linked List

#### Implementation
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Circular Linked List**

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Nodes contain data and pointers to next (and previous, in the case of doubly linked lists) nodes.
- **Advantages:** Dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions.
- **Disadvantages:** No constant-time access to elements.
- **Use Cases:** Implementing stacks, queues, and other dynamic data structures.

### Stack

#### Implementation
- **Using Arrays**
- **Using Linked Lists**

#### Explanation
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** Elements are added and removed from the same end.
- **Operations:** Push, Pop, Peek.
- **Use Cases:** Function call stack, syntax parsing.

### Queue

#### Implementation
- **Using Arrays**
- **Using Linked Lists**
- **Circular Queue**

#### Explanation
- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- **Operations:** Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear.
- **Use Cases:** Task scheduling, buffering.

### Binary Tree

#### Implementation
- Basic binary tree with traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Nodes with left and right children.
- **Traversal Methods:** In-order, pre-order, post-order.
- **Use Cases:** Expression trees, hierarchical data representation.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

#### Implementation
- Insert, delete, and search operations.

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Left child < parent, right child > parent.
- **Use Cases:** Efficient searching, sorted data representation.

### Heap

#### Implementation
- **Min-Heap**
- **Max-Heap**

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Complete binary tree, parent-child relationship.
- **Operations:** Insert, delete-min/max.
- **Use Cases:** Priority queues, heap sort.

### Hashing

#### Implementation
- Hash table with collision resolution (chaining, open addressing).

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Hash function, collision handling.
- **Use Cases:** Dictionaries, sets.

### Matrix

#### Implementation
- Basic matrix operations (addition, multiplication).
- Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Floyd-Warshall).

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** 2D array representation.
- **Use Cases:** Graph adjacency matrix, image processing.

### Trie

#### Implementation
- Insertion, search, and deletion operations.

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Prefix tree structure.
- **Use Cases:** Autocomplete, spell checker.

### Graph

#### Implementation
- Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
- Basic graph algorithms (DFS, BFS).

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Vertices, edges, directed/undirected.
- **Use Cases:** Social networks, routing algorithms.

## Advanced Data Structures

### Balanced Trees

#### AVL Tree
- Self-balancing BST with rotation operations to maintain balance.

#### Red-Black Tree
- BST with coloring properties to ensure balance.

### B-Trees

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Nodes can have more than two children.
- **Use Cases:** Databases, file systems.

### Suffix Trees and Arrays

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Efficient string processing.
- **Use Cases:** Substring search.

### Fibonacci Heaps

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Advanced heap with better amortized time for decrease-key and delete-min operations.
- **Use Cases:** Advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm.

### Disjoint Set/Union-Find

#### Explanation
- **Properties:** Manages a partition of a set.
- **Use Cases:** Network connectivity, Kruskal’s algorithm.
