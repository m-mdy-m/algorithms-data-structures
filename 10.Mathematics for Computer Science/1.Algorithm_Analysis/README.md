### The Role of Algorithms

Algorithms are central to both the science and practice of computing, a fact that has spurred the creation of numerous textbooks on the subject. These textbooks generally present algorithms in one of two ways. The first approach classifies algorithms by problem type, with separate chapters on sorting, searching, graphs, and so on. This method allows for direct comparisons of different algorithms solving the same problem, but it tends to prioritize problem types over algorithm design techniques.

The second approach organizes algorithms by design techniques, grouping together those from various areas of computing that share a common design approach. I, along with many others (e.g., [BaY95]), believe this method is more suitable for a foundational course on algorithm design and analysis. Emphasizing design techniques has three main advantages: 

1. **Practicality:** It equips students with tools for designing algorithms for new problems.
2. **Classification:** It highlights commonalities among algorithms from different areas, a major goal of computer science education.
3. **Problem Solving:** These techniques serve as general problem-solving strategies, applicable beyond computing.

However, traditional classifications of algorithm design techniques have notable shortcomings, including the inability to classify many important algorithms. This limitation has often led to textbooks switching from design technique organization to problem-type chapters, causing a loss of coherence and potential confusion for students.

### New Taxonomy of Algorithm Design Techniques

To address these issues, I developed a new taxonomy [Lev99] which serves as the basis of this book. The advantages of this new taxonomy include:

- **Comprehensiveness:** It includes strategies like brute-force, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, space and time trade-offs, and iterative improvement, often overlooked in traditional classifications.
- **Unified Presentation:** It covers many classic algorithms (e.g., Euclid’s algorithm, heapsort, search trees) that traditional taxonomies struggle to classify.
- **Variation Recognition:** It naturally accommodates important variations within several design techniques.
- **Alignment with Analytical Methods:** It is better aligned with methods for efficiency analysis (see Appendix B).

### Design Techniques as General Problem Solving Strategies

While most applications of the design techniques are to classic computer science problems, they can also be seen as general problem-solving tools. This is increasingly relevant as computing applications extend beyond traditional domains. Developing problem-solving skills is a major goal of college education, and a course on algorithm design and analysis uniquely contributes to this by offering specific strategies for solving problems.

The book includes applications to puzzles and games, systematically incorporating them beyond a few standard examples, leveraging the unique opportunity to enhance problem-solving skills through algorithm study.

### Textbook Pedagogy

My goal was to create a text that maintains the subject's rigor while being accessible for self-study. Key features include:

- **Focus on Major Ideas:** Stressing the core concepts underlying algorithm design and analysis, with selected algorithms that clearly illustrate these ideas.
- **Efficiency Analysis:** Separating methods for analyzing nonrecursive and recursive algorithms, and including sections on empirical analysis and algorithm visualization.
- **Interactive Narrative:** The text includes questions to engage the reader, some rhetorical and immediately answered, others designed to ensure comprehension.
- **Chapter Summaries:** Each chapter concludes with a recap of the most important concepts and results.
- **Exercises:** Over 600 exercises ranging from drills to challenging problems, including some leveraging Internet resources and some designed as algorithmic puzzles.
- **Hints and Solutions:** Hints for all exercises and detailed solutions (except for programming projects) are available in the Instructor’s Manual, accessible through Pearson’s Instructor Resource Center. PowerPoint slides are also available for download.

### Prerequisites

The book assumes readers have completed an introductory programming course and a standard course on discrete structures. Fundamental data structures, summation formulas, and recurrence relations are reviewed in relevant sections and appendices. Calculus is minimally used and can be omitted if necessary.

### Use in the Curriculum

This book is suitable for a basic course on design and analysis of algorithms organized around design techniques. It contains more material than a typical one-semester course can cover, allowing for flexibility in what can be skipped or assigned for self-study. A suggested plan for a one-semester course is provided, assuming a 40-class meeting format.
