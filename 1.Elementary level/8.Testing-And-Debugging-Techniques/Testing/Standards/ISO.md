# What is International Organization Standardization(ISO)

ISO stands for the International Organization for Standardization. It's an independent, non-governmental organization comprised of a vast network of specialists in various fields. This structure allows them to share and combine their expertise to establish best practices and crucial safety information. Through this collaboration, they define the most effective methods for carrying out specific tasks or processes.

An ISO standard essentially represents an internationally recognized way of performing a particular task. It signifies that everyone adheres to the same set of guidelines, regardless of location, leading to a safer and more consistent outcome. This approach benefits both the organization and the customer or end user. Companies gain assurance knowing this standard is followed and acknowledged globally. For customers, it translates to the knowledge that they're receiving a product or service that's safe, high-quality, and reliable.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO /ˈaɪsoʊ/) is an independent, non-governmental, international standard development organization composed of representatives from the national standards organizations of member countries. Membership requirements are outlined in Article 3 of the ISO Statutes.

ISO was established on February 23, 1947, and (as of January 2024) has published over 25,000 international standards encompassing nearly every facet of technology and manufacturing. It boasts over 800 technical committees (TCs) and subcommittees (SCs) dedicated to overseeing standards development.

The organization develops and publishes international standards for user-friendliness in the consumer market, encompassing both technical and non-technical fields. This includes everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, transportation, IT, agriculture, and healthcare. More specialized topics, like electrical and electronic engineering, are handled by the International Electrotechnical Commission. The organization is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The three official languages of ISO are English, French, and Russian.

## What are the different ISO standards?

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) boasts a massive collection of over 24,106 distinct standards (as of January 2024). These standards range from highly specialized topics to comprehensive frameworks.

* **Highly Specific Standards:**  Some ISO standards address very specific matters. For instance, ISO 10002 concentrates on handling customer complaints effectively.

* **General Framework Standards:**  Other ISO standards serve as overarching frameworks that can be applied to manage various processes within a business. A prime example is ISO 9001, the cornerstone for quality management systems.

Here are a few of the most widely recognized ISO standards:

* **ISO 9001: Quality Management System**  This standard outlines the requirements for a quality management system (QMS) that helps organizations consistently deliver products and services that meet customer and regulatory requirements.

* **ISO 27001: Information Security Management System**  This standard provides a framework for managing an organization's information security risks. It helps organizations protect their confidential information and ensure its availability and integrity.

* **ISO 13485: Quality Management System for Medical Devices**  This standard specifies the requirements for a quality management system focused on the design and development, production, installation, and servicing of medical devices.

It's important to note that these are just a few examples, and there are many other ISO standards applicable to various industries and aspects of business operations. 

## Structure and Organization of ISO

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a voluntary membership organization. Its members are recognized authorities on standards development, with each member body representing a single country.  These member bodies convene annually at a General Assembly to discuss and establish ISO's strategic direction.  A central secretariat, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, oversees the day-to-day operations of the organization. 

Guidance and governance are provided by a council with a rotating membership of representatives from 20 member bodies. This council is responsible for setting the annual budget for the central secretariat.

Technical Work: ISO Technical Committees and the Technical Management Board

The core function of ISO lies in developing international standards.  This work is overseen by the Technical Management Board (TMB), which manages a network of more than 250 Technical Committees (TCs) and subcommittees (SCs).  These committees bring together experts from member countries to collaboratively develop and refine ISO standards.

### Joint Technical Committee with IEC

ISO collaborates with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) through a joint technical committee (JTC) dedicated to information technology (IT) standards development.  This committee, known as JTC 1 and formally titled "Information technology," was established in 1987 with the mission of creating global Information and Communication Technology (ICT) standards applicable to both business and consumer applications.  Previously, a second joint technical committee, JTC 2, existed to develop common terminology for standardization in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, but this committee has since been disbanded.

### Membership in ISO

As of 2022, ISO boasts 167 national member bodies, with each country having only one voting representative.  Membership falls into three categories:

* **Member Bodies:** These are national standards organizations recognized as the most representative body in their respective countries.  Only member bodies hold voting rights within ISO.
* **Correspondent Members:** Countries without a national standards organization can join as correspondent members.  These members receive updates on ISO's work but do not participate in the development or promulgation of standards.
* **Subscriber Members:** Countries with smaller economies can join as subscriber members.  Subscriber members pay reduced fees and have access to follow the development of ISO standards.

### Funding  ISO

ISO's funding comes from a combination of sources:

* Project-specific contributions: Organizations managing specific ISO projects or loaning specialists to participate in technical work contribute financially.
* Member subscriptions: Member bodies pay annual subscriptions based on their country's gross national product and trade figures.
* Standard sales: Revenue is generated through the sale of published ISO standards.
## Benefits of ISO Standards

Achieving ISO certification offers several advantages for organizations, including:

* **Established Best Practices:**  ISO standards provide a framework of tried-and-tested methodologies for best practices across all facets of business operations.  Following these standards helps ensure consistent quality and efficiency throughout your organization.

* **Globally Recognized Credibility:**  ISO certification is a universally recognized symbol of quality,  simplifying the process of attracting new clients and enabling collaboration with third-party organizations.  Certification demonstrates your commitment to excellence and fosters trust with potential partners.

* **Simplified Regulatory Compliance:**  ISO standards often align with relevant regulatory requirements.  Achieving ISO certification can streamline your compliance efforts, reducing the burden of navigating complex regulations.

* **Enhanced Customer Trust:**  ISO certification signifies that your organization prioritizes quality and adheres to rigorous international standards.  This can significantly boost customer confidence in your brand and the products or services you offer.

## Managing ISO Standard Compliance

Maintaining ISO standard compliance is crucial for ensuring your organization meets global benchmarks for quality and safety.  This commitment fosters customer trust, enhances product reliability, and streamlines internal operations by minimizing errors. 

Several strategies can effectively manage ISO standard compliance:

* **Dedicated Compliance Team:**  Establish a team or designate a specific individual to oversee compliance initiatives and guarantee that all ISO requirements are met.

* **Comprehensive Compliance Plan:**  Develop a detailed plan outlining the necessary steps, timelines, and resources required to achieve and sustain ISO compliance.

* **Regular Audits and Reviews:**  Conduct internal audits and reviews at regular intervals to assess your current compliance status and identify areas for improvement.  This proactive approach helps maintain adherence to ISO standards.

* **Employee Training and Awareness:**  Invest in training and education programs to equip your staff with a thorough understanding of ISO standards and the significance of compliance.  By fostering a culture of awareness and responsibility among employees, you can ensure ongoing adherence to ISO best practices.
## International Standards and Other Publications
* **International Standards:**  These are the core deliverables of ISO and represent the most widely recognized category of ISO publications.  They are designated using a specific format: ISO[/IEC] [/ASTM] [IS] nnnnn[-p]:[yyyy] Title.  In this format, nnnnn represents the unique standard number, p is an optional part number, yyyy signifies the year of publication, and Title describes the subject matter of the standard.  The inclusion of IEC within the designation indicates that the standard originated from a collaboration with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) through their joint technical committee, JTC 1.  Similarly, ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) may be included for standards developed jointly with ASTM International.  It's important to note that yyyy and IS are omitted for unpublished or incomplete standards and may sometimes be excluded from the title of a published document.

* **Technical Reports:**  These reports are issued by technical committees or subcommittees when the compiled data differs from the kind typically included within an international standard.  Examples of such data might include references or explanations.  The naming conventions for technical reports mirror those of international standards, with the exception of "TR" replacing "IS" in the report's designation.

Here's an example of a technical report:

* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management
* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation – Metadata for construction documentation

* **Technical Specifications and Publicly Available Specifications:**  Technical specifications come into play when "the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard."  Publicly available specifications typically serve as "an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization."  The naming conventions for both types of specifications are similar to those used for technical reports.

Here are some examples:

* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation – Reference designation system – Part 1: General application rules (later withdrawn and replaced by ISO/TS 81346-3:2012, which was later withdrawn)
* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles – Roof load carriers (later revised in ISO 11154:2023, which does not have the "PAS" abbreviation in its name)

* **Technical Corrigenda:**  In collaboration with IEC within their joint technical committee, ISO may occasionally issue "technical corrigenda."  These essentially function as amendments made to existing standards to address minor technical errors or ambiguities.

* **ISO Guides:**  These act as meta-standards, providing guidance on "matters related to international standardization."  Their designation format is ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title.

Here are some examples of ISO guides:

* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities – General vocabulary
* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification (since revised and reissued as ISO/IEC 17065:2012 Conformity assessment — Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services).

**Copyright and Availability**

ISO documents are subject to strict copyright restrictions, and ISO charges fees for most copies.  As of 2020, the typical cost for a copy of an ISO standard can range from US$120 or more, and electronic copies typically come with a single-user license, restricting them from being shared amongst multiple individuals.  However, it's important to note that certain standards developed by ISO and its official U.S. representative (and via the U.S. National Committee, the International Electrotechnical Commission) are made available free of charge.
