# Project for String Manipulation Algorithms

## **1. String Transformer Tool**

**Objective**: Build a CLI tool to perform various string manipulations, including reversal, case conversion, substring replacement, splitting, and joining.

### **Requirements**:

1. Support the following operations:
   - Reversal
   - Case conversion (uppercase, lowercase, toggle case)
   - Substring replacement
   - Splitting and joining using delimiters
2. Allow users to chain multiple operations.
3. Implement an undo/redo mechanism for operations.
4. Provide a benchmarking mode to analyze performance on long strings.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Input String: "Hello World"
Operations: [Reverse -> Replace "dlroW" with "Planet" -> Uppercase]
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Transformed String: "PLANET OLLEH"
Undo History: [Uppercase -> Replace -> Reverse]
```

### **Implement**:

- Efficient string operations without built-in libraries.
- Undo/redo as a stack of operations.
- Dynamic chaining with clear operation reporting.

## **2. Compressed String Manipulation**

**Objective**: Perform transformations like substitution and splitting directly on compressed strings without decompressing them.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement basic string compression using **Huffman encoding** or **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**.
2. Design algorithms to:
   - Replace substrings within the compressed representation.
   - Split compressed strings based on encoded delimiters.
3. Compare performance with manipulation in the uncompressed domain.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Compressed String: [Encoded binary stream for "aaabbbbcc"]
Operation: Replace "bbb" with "x"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Compressed Result: [Encoded binary stream for "aaaxbcc"]
```

### **Implement**:

- Custom encoding and decoding algorithms.
- In-place transformations for efficiency.
- Debugging tools to verify correctness of compressed manipulations.

## **3. Palindrome Analyzer**

**Objective**: Create a tool to identify, generate, and manipulate palindromes within a string.

### **Requirements**:

1. Extract all substrings from a given string and identify palindromes.
2. Implement operations to:
   - Convert non-palindromes into palindromes with minimal changes.
   - Generate the largest possible palindrome by rearranging characters.
3. Support multi-language input (Unicode).

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Input String: "madame"
Operation: Convert to Palindrome
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Palindrome: "madam"
Changes: Replace 'e' with 'a'
```

### **Implement**:

- Algorithms to detect and modify palindromes efficiently.
- Multi-language support using Unicode normalization.
- Visualization of changes required.

## **4. DNA Encoder and Decoder**

**Objective**: Create an encoder to transform DNA sequences into compact representations and manipulate them efficiently.

### **Requirements**:

1. Encode DNA sequences (A, T, G, C) into binary or other compact representations.
2. Implement substring operations (e.g., search, replace, reverse) directly on the encoded form.
3. Provide a decoding mechanism to retrieve the original sequence.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
DNA Sequence: "ATGCGTAC"
Operation: Reverse and Replace "TAC" with "GCA"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Encoded Result: [Binary stream for "ATGCGCA"]
Decoded Result: "ACGCGTA"
```

### **Implement**:

- Efficient bit-level manipulations for DNA sequences.
- Error handling for corrupted encoded data.
- Benchmarks for large datasets.

## **5. String Pattern Generator**

**Objective**: Build a tool that generates strings matching specific patterns and supports transformations based on user-defined rules.

### **Requirements**:

1. Define a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for describing string patterns (e.g., `A{2}B*` for "AA" followed by any number of "B"s).
2. Implement:
   - Pattern validation.
   - String generation based on the pattern.
   - Transformations like reversal, truncation, and expansion.
3. Support recursive pattern rules (e.g., `P -> aPb`).

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Pattern: "A{2}B{3}"
Operation: Expand -> Reverse
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Generated String: "AABB"
Transformed Result: "BBBBAA"
```

### **Implement**:

- Pattern parsing with recursive rules.
- Dynamic string generation.
- Optimized algorithms for large or nested patterns.

## **6. Approximate String Distance Tool**

**Objective**: Develop a tool to compute the approximate distance between two strings and provide transformation suggestions.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement algorithms for:
   - **Levenshtein distance** (edit distance).
   - **Damerau-Levenshtein distance** (transpositions allowed).
2. Generate step-by-step suggestions to transform one string into another.
3. Extend to multi-string scenarios, comparing one string against a list.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
String 1: "kitten"
String 2: "sitting"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Edit Distance: 3
Steps:
1. Replace 'k' with 's'
2. Replace 'e' with 'i'
3. Append 'g'
```

### **Implement**:

- Visualization of transformation steps.
- Support for large-scale comparisons (e.g., spell-checking dictionaries).
- Optimized algorithms for real-time applications.
