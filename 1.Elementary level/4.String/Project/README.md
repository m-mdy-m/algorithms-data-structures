# Project for String Algorithms

## **[1. String Parsing for Natural Language Understanding](./1/)**

**Objective**: Build a parser that processes natural language text into a structured representation like a syntax tree.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement **tokenization**: Break the text into words and punctuation marks.
2. Implement **part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Assign grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb) to each token.
3. Build a basic **syntax tree**: Show relationships between words (e.g., subject, verb, object).

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Sentence: "The cat sat on the mat."
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Tokens: ["The", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", "mat", "."]
POS Tags: [Det, Noun, Verb, Prep, Det, Noun, Punct]
Syntax Tree:
(Sentence
  (NP (Det The) (Noun cat))
  (VP (Verb sat) (PP (Prep on) (NP (Det the) (Noun mat))))
)
```

### **Implement**:

- A tokenizer for splitting words and punctuation.
- A basic POS tagging system using a rule-based approach.
- A recursive algorithm to generate a syntax tree.
- Extend the project for different languages and grammatical rules.

## **[2. Text Compression and Decompression Engine](./2/)**

**Objective**: Build an efficient engine for compressing and decompressing text data using various algorithms.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement basic text compression algorithms like **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** and **Huffman Encoding**.
2. Design a system to switch between algorithms based on input data characteristics.
3. Provide support for decompression to recover the original text.
4. Analyze and visualize compression ratios and performance metrics for different datasets.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Text: "aaabbbbcccccdddddd"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Compressed: "3a4b5c6d"
Algorithm Used: RLE
Decompressed: "aaabbbbcccccdddddd"
```

### **Implement**:

- A flexible system to compare multiple compression algorithms.
- A heuristic to choose the best algorithm dynamically.
- Extend the project to handle large files and multithreaded operations.

## **[3. Advanced Pattern Matching Engine](./3/)**

**Objective**: Build a pattern-matching tool that supports approximate matching for error-tolerant searches in strings.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement exact pattern matching using **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** and **Boyer-Moore** algorithms.
2. Add approximate pattern matching using **Levenshtein Distance** to allow mismatches, insertions, or deletions.
3. Support wildcard characters (e.g., `*` matches any sequence of characters).
4. Visualize the matching process step-by-step.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Text: "hello world"
Pattern: "h*o"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Match Found at Index: 0
Steps:
  Step 1: Compare 'h' with 'h' -> Match
  Step 2: '*' matches 'ello w'
  Step 3: Compare 'o' with 'o' -> Match
```

### **Implement**:

- An efficient search engine supporting both exact and approximate matching.
- Extend the tool to work with DNA sequences or log analysis for real-world applications.

## **[4. Syntax Highlighting for Code Snippets](./4/)**

**Objective**: Develop a syntax highlighter for programming languages, using string parsing and pattern matching.

### **Requirements**:

1. Parse code snippets and tokenize them into keywords, operators, literals, and comments.
2. Apply color-coded syntax highlighting based on language rules.
3. Support multiple languages like JavaScript, Python, C, and Java.
4. Include an option to save highlighted code as HTML for web display.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Code: "int main() { printf(\"Hello, World!\"); return 0; }"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Highlighted Code:
<int> int </int> <function>main</function>() { <function>printf</function>("Hello, World!"); <keyword>return</keyword> <number>0</number>; }
```

### **Implement**:

- A parser to identify different token types.
- Extend the tool to support custom themes and styles.
- Optimize for large files and integrate with your text editor project.

## **[5. Text-Based Password Strength Analyzer](./5/)**

**Objective**: Build a tool to analyze the strength of passwords based on string algorithms and entropy calculation.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement checks for common weaknesses (e.g., dictionary words, repetitive patterns).
2. Calculate password entropy to measure unpredictability.
3. Provide suggestions for improving password strength.
4. Add a visualization for the analysis process.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Password: "password123"
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Strength: Weak
Entropy: 20 bits
Issues: Contains common words, lacks special characters.
Suggestions: Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
```

### **Implement**:

- Use string matching to detect dictionary words and repetitive patterns.
- Extend the tool to simulate brute-force attacks for realistic analysis.
- Integrate the analyzer into a web or CLI-based application.

## **[4. Plagiarism Detection Engine](./4/)**

**Objective**: Build a robust engine to detect text similarity and identify potential plagiarism across multiple documents or datasets.

### **Requirements**:

1. Implement **n-gram analysis** to split text into overlapping sequences for comparison.
2. Use **Jaccard Similarity** and **Cosine Similarity** metrics for measuring similarity between documents.
3. Design a **hashing-based approach** (e.g., MinHash or SimHash) to efficiently compare large datasets.
4. Build a visualization tool to highlight plagiarized sections in compared documents.

### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Document 1: "Plagiarism detection is an important application of string algorithms."
Document 2: "Detection of plagiarism is a critical use of string techniques."
```

### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Similarity Score: 85%
Highlighted Matches:
Document 1: "Plagiarism detection is an *important application* of string algorithms."
Document 2: "Detection of plagiarism is a *critical use* of string techniques."
```

### **Implement**:

- A preprocessing step to normalize input text (e.g., remove stopwords, lowercase).
- Efficient data structures like **trie** or **suffix trees** to improve comparison speed.
- Extend the system to detect paraphrased content and multi-language plagiarism.
- Integrate with a backend service to handle user uploads and generate detailed reports.

### **2. Intelligent Autocomplete System**

**Objective**: Develop an autocomplete tool that suggests possible completions based on a partial input and context from a document or codebase.

#### **Requirements**:

1. Implement **Trie** or **Suffix Tree** to store a large dataset of words or code completions.
2. Integrate **n-gram** or **Markov Chains** to predict the next word or phrase based on context.
3. Implement an efficient ranking system for suggestions using frequency, user behavior, or relevance to the current input.
4. Provide a backend API to dynamically update suggestions based on the context of the input.
5. Create a web frontend that renders suggestions in real-time as users type.

#### **Example Input**:

```plaintext
Text: "int a = 10; in"
```

#### **Example Output**:

```plaintext
Suggestions: ["int", "insert", "include"]
```
