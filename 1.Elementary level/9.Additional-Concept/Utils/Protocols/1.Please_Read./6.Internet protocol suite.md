# What is Internet protocol suite

The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is a comprehensive framework for organizing a set of communication protocols used across the Internet and similar computer networks. This suite is integral to modern networking, ensuring seamless communication and data transfer. The foundational protocols within this suite include the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP). These protocols were initially developed with funding from the United States Department of Defense through DARPA, leading to the early versions of this networking model being referred to as the Department of Defense (DoD) model.

The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication by specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, each classifying related protocols according to their networking scope. These layers are essential in defining the protocol stack for any application. The layers, from lowest to highest, are:

1. **Link Layer**: This layer encompasses communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link). It includes protocols like Ethernet and Wi-Fi, which handle the physical transmission of data over the network medium.
   
2. **Internet Layer**: Responsible for internetworking between independent networks, this layer primarily uses the Internet Protocol (IP) to route packets across network boundaries. It ensures that data packets can traverse multiple interconnected networks to reach their destination.

3. **Transport Layer**: This layer manages host-to-host communication. It includes protocols like TCP and UDP, which facilitate data transfer between devices by ensuring reliable and ordered delivery (TCP) or providing faster, connectionless communication (UDP).

4. **Application Layer**: The highest layer, it provides process-to-process data exchange for applications. It includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, which support various Internet services and applications, such as web browsing, file transfer, and email.

The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open standards organization dedicated to the continuous development and evolution of Internet technologies.

The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). While the OSI model offers a more detailed abstraction with seven layers, the four-layer TCP/IP model remains fundamental to the operation of the Internet, highlighting its enduring significance and efficiency in managing complex network communications.

By effectively addressing the intricacies of data transmission and ensuring robust, scalable, and interoperable network interactions, the Internet protocol suite has become the cornerstone of global digital communication, supporting a vast array of applications and services that drive today's interconnected world.

## History

### Early Research

Initially referred to as the DoD Internet Architecture Model, the Internet protocol suite has its roots in research and development sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the late 1960s . After DARPA initiated the pioneering ARPANET in 1969, Steve Crocker established a "Networking Working Group" which developed a host-to-host protocol known as the Network Control Program (NCP) . In the early 1970s, DARPA started work on several other data transmission technologies, including mobile packet radio, packet satellite service, local area networks, and other data networks in the public and private domains. 

In 1972, Bob Kahn joined the DARPA Information Processing Technology Office, where he worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks. Recognizing the value of cross-network communication, Kahn aimed to develop a system that could link different networks  . In the spring of 1973, Vinton Cerf joined Kahn with the goal of designing the next generation protocol for the ARPANET to enable internetworking. They drew on experiences from the ARPANET research community, the International Network Working Group (chaired by Cerf), and researchers at Xerox PARC   .

By the summer of 1973, Kahn and Cerf had devised a fundamental reformulation. They proposed hiding the differences between local network protocols using a common internetwork protocol and delegating the responsibility for reliability to the hosts rather than the network itself. Cerf credits Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann, designers of the CYCLADES network, with important influences on this design  . The new protocol was implemented as the Transmission Control Program in 1974 by Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine .

Initially, the Transmission Control Program (the Internet Protocol did not yet exist as a separate protocol) provided only a reliable byte stream service to its users, not datagram service . As experience with the protocol grew, collaborators recommended splitting functionality into layers of distinct protocols, allowing users direct access to datagram service. Advocates included Danny Cohen, who needed it for his packet voice work; Jonathan Postel of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, who edited the Request for Comments (RFCs) series that documented and catalyzed Internet development; and Bob Metcalfe and Yogen Dalal at Xerox PARC   . Postel stated, "We are screwing up in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering" . Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended to create an environment where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. In version 4, written in 1978, Postel split the Transmission Control Program into two distinct protocols: the Internet Protocol as a connectionless layer and the Transmission Control Protocol as a reliable connection-oriented service   .

The network design recognized that it should provide only the functions of efficiently transmitting and routing traffic between end nodes, with all other intelligence located at the network's edge, in the end nodes. This principle, known as the end-to-end principle, was pioneered by Louis Pouzin in the CYCLADES network. Using this design, it became possible to connect other networks to the ARPANET that used the same principle, irrespective of other local characteristics, thereby solving Kahn's initial internetworking problem. A popular expression is that TCP/IP, the eventual product of Cerf and Kahn's work, can run over "two tin cans and a string." Years later, as a joke, the IP over Avian Carriers formal protocol specification was created and successfully tested.

DARPA contracted with BBN Technologies, Stanford University, and University College London to develop operational versions of the protocol on several hardware platforms . During the protocol's development, the version number of the packet routing layer progressed from version 1 to version 4, which was installed in the ARPANET in 1983. This version became known as Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), still in use today alongside its successor, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

### Early Implementation

In 1975, a two-network IP communications test was performed between Stanford and University College London. In November 1977, a three-network IP test was conducted between sites in the US, the UK, and Norway. Several other IP prototypes were developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983 .

A computer called a router, initially referred to as a gateway, is provided with an interface to each network. It forwards network packets back and forth between them . The term was changed to avoid confusion with other types of gateways .

### Adoption

In March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking   . That same year, NORSAR/NDRE and Peter Kirstein's research group at University College London adopted the protocol . The migration of the ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP was officially completed on Flag Day, January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were permanently activated  .

In 1985, the Internet Advisory Board (later the Internet Architecture Board) held a three-day TCP/IP workshop for the computer industry, attended by 250 vendor representatives, promoting the protocol and leading to its increasing commercial use. That same year, the first Interop conference, focused on network interoperability through broader TCP/IP adoption, was founded by Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the beginning, large corporations such as IBM and DEC attended the meeting  .

IBM, AT&T, and DEC were among the first major corporations to adopt TCP/IP, despite having competing proprietary protocols. Beginning in 1984, Barry Appelman's group at IBM developed TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including MVS, VM, and OS/2. Concurrently, several smaller companies, such as FTP Software and the Wollongong Group, began offering TCP/IP stacks for DOS and Microsoft Windows . The first VM/CMS TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin .

Some early TCP/IP stacks were written single-handedly by a few programmers. Jay Elinsky and Oleg Vishnepolsky of IBM Research wrote TCP/IP stacks for VM/CMS and OS/2, respectively. In 1984, Donald Gillies at MIT wrote a multi-connection TCP, running atop the IP/PacketDriver layer maintained by John Romkey at MIT in 1983-84. Romkey leveraged this TCP in 1986 when FTP Software was founded  . Starting in 1985, Phil Karn created a multi-connection TCP application for ham radio systems (KA9Q TCP) .

The spread of TCP/IP was further fueled in June 1989 when the University of California, Berkeley agreed to place the TCP/IP code developed for BSD UNIX into the public domain. Various corporate vendors, including IBM, incorporated this code into commercial TCP/IP software releases. Microsoft released a native TCP/IP stack in Windows 95, cementing TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols on Microsoft-based networks, such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), and on other platforms like Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, engineers, organizations, and nations were polarized over whether the OSI model or the Internet protocol suite would result in the best and most robust computer networks   .

### Formal Specification and Standards

The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols have been delegated to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  .

The characteristic architecture of the Internet protocol suite is its broad division into operating scopes for the protocols that constitute its core functionality. The defining specification of the suite is RFC 1122, which broadly outlines four abstraction layers . These layers have stood the test of time, as the IETF has never modified this structure. As a model of networking, the Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems .
