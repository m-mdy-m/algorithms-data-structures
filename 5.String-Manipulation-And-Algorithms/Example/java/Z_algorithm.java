Index   | Text Character  | Z-function Value  | Explanation (Visualized)
------- | --------------  | ----------------- | ------------------------
0       | A               | 0                 | The first character, so no prefix match (empty string). Represented by an empty box.
1       | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 1 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X" indicating no match.
2       | A               | 1                 | "A" itself is the longest prefix match starting at index 2. Represented by a box containing "A".
3       | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 3 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
4       | D               | 0                 | No prefix match starting at index 4 is a substring of the entire string (since "AB" is not a prefix of "ABABDABACDABABCABAB"). Represented by an empty box.
5       | A               | 2                 | The longest prefix match starting at index 5 is "AB" (shown as a highlighted box).
6       | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 6 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
7       | A               | 1                 | "A" itself is the longest prefix match starting at index 7. Represented by a box containing "A".
8       | C               | 0                 | No prefix match starting at index 8 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by an empty box.
9       | D               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 9 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
10      | A               | 3                 | The longest prefix match starting at index 10 is "ABA" (shown as a highlighted box).
11      | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 11 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
12      | A               | 1                 | "A" itself is the longest prefix match starting at index 12. Represented by a box containing "A".
13      | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 13 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
14      | C               | 0                 | No prefix match starting at index 14 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by an empty box.
15      | A               | 3                 | The longest prefix match starting at index 15 is "ABA" (shown as a highlighted box).
16      | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 16 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
17      | A               | 1                 | "A" itself is the longest prefix match starting at index 17. Represented by a box containing "A".
18      | B               | -1                | No prefix match starting at index 18 is a substring of the entire string. Represented by a box with "X".
