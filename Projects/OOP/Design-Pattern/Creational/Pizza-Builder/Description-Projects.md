##  Pizza Builder with Builder Design Pattern

This project will create a pizza ordering system using the Builder design pattern. Users can customize their pizzas step-by-step, choosing their crust size, sauce, cheese, and toppings.

###  Choosing a Language

You can implement this project in various programming languages that support object-oriented programming concepts. Here are some popular choices:

* **Python:** A beginner-friendly language with clear syntax, making it a great choice for this project.
* **Java:** A widely used language in object-oriented programming, offering good libraries and resources for learning design patterns.
* **JavaScript:** While not traditionally object-oriented at its core, JavaScript can be used with object-oriented principles. Consider libraries like TypeScript for a more structured approach.
* **TypeScript:** Offers strong typing and static code checking for better code quality.
* **Go:** Compiled language known for its simplicity, speed, and ease of use.

**Choosing a language depends on your experience and preference. Python or JavaScript might be easier to start with, while Java or C# offer more robust object-oriented features.**

###  Implementation Breakdown:

Here's a breakdown of how to implement the Pizza Builder project:

**1. Define Classes:**

* **Pizza:** This class will represent the final pizza object with attributes like size, sauce, cheese, toppings, and price.
* **Crust:** This class will define different crust types (thin, thick, stuffed) with potential price variations.
* **Sauce:** Similar to Crust, this class will define different sauce options (tomato, pesto, white) with possible price differences.
* **Cheese:** Define various cheese types (mozzarella, cheddar, vegan) with potential price variations.
* **Topping:** This class will represent individual toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions) with a price per unit.
* **PizzaBuilder:** This class implements the Builder design pattern. It will have methods for setting the crust, sauce, cheese, and adding toppings. It will ultimately return a complete Pizza object.


**2. Builder Implementation:**

* The `PizzaBuilder` class will have methods like `setCrust(Crust crust)`, `setSauce(Sauce sauce)`, `setCheese(Cheese cheese)`, and `addTopping(Topping topping)`.
* Each method will update internal variables within the `PizzaBuilder` object, keeping track of the chosen options.
* Implement a `build()` method that returns a final `Pizza` object with all the chosen configurations and calculates the total price based on individual ingredient prices.


**3. User Interaction:**

*  Design a simple user interface (text-based or graphical) to guide users through the pizza building process.
*  Present options for each step (crust, sauce, cheese, toppings) and allow users to select their choices.
*  Utilize the `PizzaBuilder` methods to configure the pizza based on user selections.
*  After building the pizza, display the final configuration and calculated price.


**4. (Optional) Predefined Pizzas:**

* Create classes for pre-defined pizzas like Hawaiian (with specific crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings).
* These classes can inherit from the `Pizza` class and define their specific configurations.
* Offer users the option to choose from pre-defined pizzas alongside custom building.
