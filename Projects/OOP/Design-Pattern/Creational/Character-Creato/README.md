## Character Creator with Design Patterns (Choose Your Language) 

> Abstract Factory âœ”

Craft a versatile character creator for your game or story! This project allows you to define different character types and their attributes using either the Abstract Factory or Singleton pattern.

**Select a language to proceed (choose one):**

1. **Python (**Beginner-friendly**):** Simple and clear syntax makes Python a great choice for learning design patterns and building the core logic of your character creator.
2. **Java (**Object-Oriented Power**):** Java's object-oriented features are well-suited for implementing design patterns and creating robust character classes.
3. **JavaScript (**Web-based Flexibility**):** Build a web-based character creator with JavaScript, allowing users to interact and create characters through a web interface.
4. **TypeScript (**Structured & Safe**):** Offers strong typing and static code checking, ensuring a well-structured and reliable character creator implementation.
5. **Go (**Simple & Performant**):** Go's simplicity and speed make it a good choice for creating a performant character creator focused on core functionalities.

**Once you choose a language, follow the implementation steps below specific to that language.**

**General Implementation Steps:**

1. **Character Classes:**

    * **Character:** This base class defines common attributes (e.g., name, health, mana) and methods (e.g., attack, defend) shared by all character types.
    * **Concrete Character Classes:** Implement subclasses like Warrior, Mage, and Archer that inherit from the base Character class and define their specific attributes (e.g., higher strength for Warrior) and abilities (e.g., different attack types).

2. **Factory Pattern Choice:**

    **a) Abstract Factory:**

        * Define an abstract `CharacterFactory` interface with methods like `createWarrior()`, `createMage()`, and `createArcher()`. These methods return instances of the corresponding character subclasses.
        * Implement concrete factories like `WarriorFactory`, `MageFactory`, and `ArcherFactory` that implement the `CharacterFactory` interface and create specific character objects with their unique attributes and abilities.

    **b) Singleton Pattern:**

        * Implement a singleton class called `CharacterFactory` that provides methods like `createWarrior()`, `createMage()`, and `createArcher()`. These methods internally handle the logic of creating the corresponding character objects based on the chosen type.

3. **Customization (Optional):**

    * Allow users to choose specific weapons or equipment for certain character types (e.g., sword and shield for Warrior).
    * Consider offering options to modify some base attributes within a range (e.g., prioritize strength or dexterity for a Warrior).

4. **User Interface (Optional):**

    * Design a text-based or graphical interface for users to interact with the character creator.
    * Present options for selecting character types and any available customization choices.
    * Display the created character's details (name, attributes, abilities) after creation.

5. **Testing and Improvements:**

    * Implement unit tests to ensure each class and method functions as expected.
    * Consider adding features like:
        * More character types with unique abilities.
        * Skill trees for character development.
        * Visual representation of characters with different equipment choices.

**Choosing the Pattern:**

* **Abstract Factory:** Offers more flexibility by allowing for multiple concrete factories and potential future expansion with new character types.
* **Singleton Pattern:** Provides a central point for character creation and simplifies access, but might be less flexible for future additions.

**Remember, this is a starting point. You can customize and extend this project to create a character creator that perfectly fits your needs!**
