## Maze Game with Factory Method or Prototype Pattern

This project involves creating a simple maze game where the player navigates through a maze layout. You can choose to implement either the Factory Method or Prototype pattern to generate different maze configurations.

### Choosing a Language

1. **Python (**Beginner-friendly**):** Simple and clear syntax makes it perfect for learning design patterns and game development with libraries like Pygame.
2. **Java (**Graphical Powerhouse**):** Widely used for game development, Java offers libraries like JavaFX for creating stunning graphical interfaces for your maze.
3. **JavaScript (**Web-based Wonder**):** Craft web-based maze games with libraries like Phaser or PixiJS, allowing you to share your creation online.
4. **TypeScript (**Structured & Safe**):** Offers strong typing and static code checking for a well-structured and reliable maze game implementation.
5. **Go (**Simple & Performant**):** Compiled language known for its simplicity and speed, Go is a great choice for creating a performant maze game.

**Once you choose a language, follow the implementation steps below specific to that language.**

### Implementation Breakdown:

Here's a breakdown of how to implement the Maze Game project, considering both Factory Method and Prototype Pattern approaches:

**1. Game Structure:**

* **Maze:** This class will represent the maze itself, containing the layout (walls, paths), player starting position, and potentially exit location.
* **Player:** This class will represent the player character with attributes like position and movement functionality.
* **Game Engine:** This will manage the overall game loop, handling user input, updating the player's position, and checking for collisions with walls or other elements.
* **(Optional) Enemy/Item:** Implement classes for enemies that move within the maze or collectible items the player can gather.


**2. Maze Generation:**

**a) Factory Method Approach:**

* Create a base `MazeFactory` class with a method like `createMaze(difficultyLevel: string)`.
* Implement concrete subclasses like `SmallMazeFactory`, `MediumMazeFactory`, and `LargeMazeFactory` that each generate a specific maze layout based on the difficulty level.
* The `Game Engine` can use the `createMaze` method with the chosen difficulty to obtain the appropriate maze instance.

**b) Prototype Pattern Approach:**

* Define a base `Maze` class with methods representing the maze structure (e.g., `getWallPositions`).
* Create concrete maze subclasses like `SmallMaze`, `MediumMaze`, and `LargeMaze` that define their specific layouts.
* Implement a `clone` method within the `Maze` class that allows creating a copy of the maze object.
* The `Game Engine` can start with a base `Maze` instance and then clone it to create variations for different difficulty levels, potentially modifying specific sections of the cloned maze.


**3. User Interaction and Gameplay:**

* Design a user interface (text-based or graphical) to display the maze and player position.
* Allow users to move the player character with keyboard or mouse controls.
* Implement collision detection to prevent the player from moving through walls.
* Update the game state based on player movement and interactions with enemies or items (if included).
* Implement a win/lose condition (reaching the exit or encountering an enemy).


**4. Visual Representation (Optional):**

* For a text-based approach, use characters like "#" for walls and "@" for the player.
* For a graphical approach, use libraries like Pygame, JavaFX, or Phaser to create a visual representation of the maze and player.


**5. Testing and Improvements:**

* Implement unit tests to ensure each class and method functions as expected.
* Consider adding features like:
    * Multiple difficulty levels with varying maze sizes and complexities.
    * Enemies with different movement patterns or behaviors.
    * Power-ups or collectible items that enhance player abilities.
    * Scoring system based on time taken or items collected.


**Choosing the Pattern:**

* The Factory Method offers a central place to manage maze creation for different difficulties.
* The Prototype pattern is useful if you want to create variations based on a base maze structure.
