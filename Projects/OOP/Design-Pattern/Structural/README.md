# Professional Image Editor: A Symphony of Structural Design Patterns

This project envisions the development of a robust image editor application that leverages the power of structural design patterns to achieve flexibility, maintainability, and memory efficiency. The editor will cater to the diverse needs of graphic designers, photographers, and artists, offering a comprehensive set of features while adhering to object-oriented design principles.

## Structural Design Patterns in Action:

1. **Adapter:**
   - **Purpose:** Enable seamless import and export of various image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.).
   - **Implementation:** Create adapter classes that bridge the gap between external file formats and the editor's internal representation. Each adapter handles the specifics of a particular format, converting data into a format compatible with the editor's core functionality.

2. **Bridge:**
   - **Purpose:** Decouple the image representation (abstraction) from the filter application logic (implementation). This allows for independent evolution of both aspects without affecting the other.
   - **Implementation:** Design image and filter classes as separate hierarchies. An abstract base class for filters can define common operations, with concrete filter classes (e.g., GrayscaleFilter, BlurFilter) implementing specific effects. This separation allows for adding new filters without modifying the existing image representation.

3. **Composite:**
   - **Purpose:** Implement a layered image structure for non-destructive editing.
   - **Implementation:** Create a base `ImageComponent` class representing both individual image elements (pixels) and composite elements (layers). Concrete class `ImageLayer` inherits from `ImageComponent` and can contain other `ImageComponent` objects. This hierarchical structure allows for manipulating individual layers or the entire image.

4. **Decorator:**
   - **Purpose:** Dynamically add image filters and effects without modifying the core editing functionality.
   - **Implementation:** Develop a base `ImageFilter` class that defines a common interface for applying transformations. Concrete filter classes (e.g., GrayscaleDecorator, BlurDecorator) inherit from `ImageFilter` and dynamically modify an image passed through them. Users can chain multiple filters for complex effects while maintaining the original image data.

5. **Facade:**
   - **Purpose:** Present a simplified user interface for commonly used editing functions.
   - **Implementation:** Establish a `EditingFacade` class that acts as a central hub of interaction, hiding the complexity of underlying filter and layer manipulation logic. This facade exposes methods like `applyFilter` and `adjustLayerProperties`, making the application user-friendly.

6. **Flyweight:**
   - **Purpose:** Optimize memory usage when dealing with large images or frequently applied filters.
   - **Implementation:** Create a `FilterFactory` class responsible for storing and sharing instances of commonly used filters. The factory ensures that only one instance of a filter exists, even if used on multiple images. This reduces memory consumption by sharing common filter state.

7. **Proxy:**
   - **Purpose:** Control access to filters and image resources, implementing access control, caching, and lazy loading.
   - **Implementation:** Develop a `FilterProxy` class that intercepts requests for applying filters. The proxy can perform pre-processing checks (e.g., user permissions, filter availability) before delegating the actual filtering to the appropriate filter object. Additionally, the proxy might implement lazy loading of filters, ensuring they are loaded only when needed, further improving performance.

## Benefits of Structural Design Patterns:

* **Enhanced Modularity:** Each pattern encapsulates a specific functionality, leading to a more modular codebase, easier to maintain and extend. New features can be integrated without significant code modifications.
* **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The application can readily adapt to new requirements due to the decoupled design patterns. Adding new filters, format support, or editing tools becomes easier.
* **Improved Performance and Memory Management:** Patterns like Flyweight and Proxy help optimize memory usage, especially for large images or complex editing workflows.
