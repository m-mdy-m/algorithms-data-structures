# Text Summarization

## Text Summarization with Z Algorithm (Pseudocode)

This project aims to automatically generate a concise summary of a given text document using the Z-algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved and the pseudocode for each stage:

**1. Preprocessing (Optional):**

- This step is optional but can improve the quality of the summary.
- Remove punctuation marks, stop words (common words like "the", "a", "an"), and convert all characters to lowercase.

**Pseudocode (Preprocessing):**

```
function Preprocess(text):
  # Replace punctuation with spaces
  text = replace_all(text, "[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", " ")
  # Convert to lowercase
  text = to_lowercase(text)
  # Split text into words (tokens)
  words = split(text)
  # Remove stop words (if needed)
  words = filter(words, is_not_stopword)
  # Join words back into a string
  text = join(words)
  return text
```

**2. Z-Box Construction:**

- Implement the Z-algorithm to create a Z-box for the preprocessed text.
- The Z-box will contain an integer for each position in the text, representing the length of the longest prefix-suffix match starting at that position.

**Pseudocode (Z-Box Construction):**

```
function Z_Box(text):
  n = length(text)
  Z = [0] * n
  for i in range(1, n):
    # Find the longest prefix-suffix match starting at i
    k = max(min(Z[i - j], n - i - 1) for j in range(1, i + 1))
    Z[i] = k
  return Z
```

**3. Frequent Phrase Identification:**

- Iterate through the Z-box.
- Identify positions where the Z-box value (Z[i]) is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 3).
- These positions represent the starting points of frequently occurring phrases within the text.

**Pseudocode (Frequent Phrase Identification):**

```
function FrequentPhrases(text, Z, threshold):
  phrases = []
  for i in range(len(text)):
    if Z[i] >= threshold:
      # Extract the phrase starting at i with length Z[i]
      phrase = text[i : i + Z[i]]
      phrases.append(phrase)
  return phrases
```

**4. Phrase Ranking (Optional):**

- This step is optional but can improve the quality of the summary.
- Assign a score to each phrase based on its frequency (Z-box value) or relevance to the overall content (using techniques like word embedding or topic modeling).

**Pseudocode (Phrase Ranking - Optional):**

```
function RankPhrases(phrases, Z):
  # Assign scores based on Z-box values
  for i in range(len(phrases)):
    phrases[i] = (phrases[i], Z[phrases[i].index(phrases[i][0])])  # Store phrase and Z-box value as a tuple
  # Sort phrases by their scores (descending order)
  phrases.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return phrases
```

**5. Summary Generation:**

- Select the top N phrases (based on frequency or ranking) to represent the key points of the text.
- Join the selected phrases with appropriate separators (e.g., ". ") to form the summary.

**Pseudocode (Summary Generation):**

```
function GenerateSummary(text, phrases, top_n):
  summary = ""
  for i in range(min(top_n, len(phrases))):
    summary += phrases[i] + ". "
  return summary.strip()
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

- You may need to implement functions like `replace_all`, `to_lowercase`, `split`, `filter`, `join`, and `min` depending on the chosen programming language.
- Stop word lists can be readily found online for various languages.
- Consider using libraries or pre-trained models for stop word removal and word embedding (if used for ranking).

**Example**
```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox is a very clever animal."
summary = summarize_text(text)
print("Summary:", summary)
```

**Example Output:**

```
Summary: quick brown fox very clever animal
```
