# My Algorithms & CS Journey

This repo is where I drop all the cool stuff I learn while diving into algorithms, data structures, and computer science in general.

I'm not here to teach anyone.
This is just my personal space to experiment, break things, build things, and collect ideas that I find interesting or useful.

No tutorials, no fancy guides — just raw learning, exploration, and a bit of chaos.
Think of it as a messy but honest journal of my journey through the CS rabbit hole.

## What's Inside?

I've split things into levels that (kinda) match my own learning curve:

- [Elementary](./1.Elementary%20level) – The basics, the first steps.
- [Intermediate](./2.Intermediate%20Level) – Starting to get my hands dirty.
- [Advanced](./3.Advanced%20level) – Headaches and "aha" moments.
- [Thanos Level](./4.Thanos%20level) – Stuff that _snaps_ my brain.
- [Merlin Level](./5.Merlin%20level) – Magic? Madness? Who knows.

## Notes & Progress

Sometimes I’ll reflect, write notes, or just dump thoughts here.
No promise of organization, but it’s all real.

That’s it. If you’re here, cool. If not, also cool.
