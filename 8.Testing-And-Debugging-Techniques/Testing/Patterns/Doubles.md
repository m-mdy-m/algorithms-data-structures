# What are Test Doubles?
In software development, test doubles are specialized tools employed in unit testing to simulate real-world components that your code interacts with. They provide a controlled environment, allowing you to isolate and test the functionality of your code without relying on external dependencies. This is particularly useful when testing units that require complex inputs, interact with external systems, or have dependencies that are difficult or time-consuming to set up in a testing environment.

Test doubles mimic the behavior of the actual components, enabling you to define specific interactions and verify if your code reacts as expected. This isolation improves the speed, reliability, and maintainability of your unit tests. There are various types of test doubles, each serving a distinct purpose:

* **Mocks:** Mocks are pre-programmed with specific expectations about how they will be interacted with during the test. They can verify if your code calls them with the correct arguments and in the expected order. Additionally, mocks can be configured to return specific values or throw exceptions to simulate different scenarios.

* **Stubs:** Stubs offer a simpler form of test double. They provide basic functionality but lack the ability to verify interactions. Stubs are useful for isolating your code's behavior when interacting with external systems or complex dependencies. They simply return predetermined values or perform predefined actions.

* **Spies:** Spies record how they are interacted with during the test. They are similar to mocks but without the ability to define expectations. Spies allow you to verify if your code called them with specific arguments and how many times they were called. This is helpful for understanding how your code interacts with its dependencies.

* **Fakes:** Fakes are fully functional replacements for real components, often designed specifically for testing purposes. They may take shortcuts or use alternative implementations compared to the production code, but they provide a realistic simulation of the component's behavior for testing.
## Why Use Test Doubles?

While it might seem tempting to test your code directly with real-world components, test doubles offer a multitude of advantages that enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of your unit testing process. Here's a breakdown of the key reasons why developers leverage test doubles:

* **Isolation:** Test doubles enable you to isolate the specific piece of code you're testing from its external dependencies. This means you're not relying on external systems, databases, or other components to be available or functioning correctly. This isolation ensures that any failures or errors originate within the code under test, not from external factors, leading to more focused and reliable tests.

* **Efficiency:**  Testing with real dependencies can be time-consuming and cumbersome. External systems might have slow response times, be unavailable during testing, or require specific configurations. Test doubles allow you to control the behavior of dependencies, speeding up test execution significantly. You can define specific responses or interactions, allowing you to focus on testing specific scenarios without needing the entire system to be operational.

* **Control and Flexibility:** Test doubles provide a high degree of control over the behavior of your code's dependencies. You can define specific outputs, exceptions, or interactions to simulate various situations. This flexibility empowers you to create targeted test cases that explore edge cases, error handling, and specific functionalities without relying on the real-world behavior of external components.

* **Reliability:**  Real-world dependencies can be unreliable or prone to errors. Test doubles eliminate this element of uncertainty by providing predictable and controllable behavior. This ensures that your tests consistently execute as expected, leading to more reliable test results and a higher confidence level in your code's quality.

* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**  Test doubles are instrumental in the practice of TDD. By allowing you to create a testing environment independent of external dependencies, you can write tests that guide the development process. You define the expected behavior of your code before writing the actual implementation, ensuring the code fulfills its intended purpose from the outset.
## Test Doubles Examples

Imagine you're developing a web application with a payment gateway integration. Testing the checkout process with the real payment gateway can be a hassle. It might be slow due to network delays, unavailable during testing windows, or require specific configurations. This is where test doubles come in handy.

Test doubles act as stand-ins for real-world components, mimicking their behavior within your testing environment. In the payment gateway example, a test double can simulate the API's responses, allowing you to test various scenarios like successful payments, failures, network errors, or timeouts. This controlled approach facilitates comprehensive testing of the checkout process, including error handling and edge cases, without relying on the actual payment gateway. It streamlines testing by:

* **Eliminating External Dependencies:** You're not waiting for the real payment gateway to be available, speeding up tests significantly.
* **Simulating Various Responses:**  You can define specific responses to test different payment scenarios (success, failure, error) in a controlled manner.
* **Ensuring Reliable Tests:** Test doubles eliminate the uncertainty of real-world dependencies, leading to consistent and reliable test results. 
```javascript
// Define a test double for the payment gateway API
const paymentGatewayTestDouble = {
  successfulPayment: (amount) => ({
    status: 'success',
    transactionId: '123456789',
    amount,
    currency: 'USD'
  }),
  failedPayment: (errorMessage) => ({
    status: 'failure',
    errorMessage
  }),
  networkError: () => {
    throw new Error('Network error: Unable to connect to payment gateway');
  }
};

// Define a mock for the user object
const mockUser = {
  getUserId: () => 'user-2004',
  getUsername: () => 'Mahdi',
  getEmail: () => 'mahdi.mm@example.com',
};

// Example usage of the test double and mock
function processPayment(user, amount) {
  // Simulate logic using user information (could be mocked differently)
  if (!user || !user.getUserId()) {
    throw new Error('Invalid user information');
  }
  
  // Simulate making a payment request using the paymentGateway double
  if (amount > 0 && amount < 1000) {
    return paymentGatewayTestDouble.successfulPayment(amount);
  } else if (amount >= 1000) {
    return paymentGatewayTestDouble.failedPayment('Payment amount exceeds limit');
  } else {
    return paymentGatewayTestDouble.networkError();
  }
}

// Example usage with successful payment
try {
  const paymentResult = processPayment(mockUser, 50);
  console.log('Payment successful:', paymentResult);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Payment error:', error.message);
}

// Example usage with failed payment due to amount exceeding limit
try {
  const paymentResult = processPayment(mockUser, 1500);
  console.log('Payment successful:', paymentResult); 
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Payment error:', error.message);
}
```
## Types of Test Doubles
**General-Purpose Test Doubles:**

* **Stub:** A simple test double that provides predefined outputs or behaviors in response to specific interactions. Stubs are useful for isolating the code under test from complex dependencies or external systems. They typically don't verify interactions or hold expectations about how they are called.

* **Mock:**  A more advanced test double that allows you to define expectations about how it will be interacted with during the test. Mocks can verify if your code calls them with the correct arguments and in the expected order. Additionally, mocks can be configured to return specific values, throw exceptions, or track the number of times they are called, providing more control over the testing scenario.

* **Spy:** Similar to mocks, spies record how they are interacted with during the test. However, unlike mocks, spies don't allow you to define expectations beforehand.  This makes them useful for understanding how your code interacts with its dependencies and verifying if it called them with specific arguments or how many times they were called.

* **Fake:** A fully functional replacement for a real component, often designed specifically for testing purposes. Fakes may take shortcuts or use alternative implementations compared to the production code, but they provide a realistic simulation of the component's behavior for testing. This can be helpful when testing integrations with external systems or complex dependencies that are difficult or expensive to set up in a testing environment.

* **Dummy Object:** A simple placeholder object used to fulfill method or parameter requirements but has no actual functionality relevant to the test. Dummy objects are helpful for satisfying dependencies that the code under test interacts with but are not directly relevant to the specific functionality being tested.

**Service-Oriented Test Doubles:**

In the context of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices, specific test doubles are used to simulate interactions with external services over network protocols. These doubles are referred to by various names depending on the testing tool or framework:

* **Service Virtualization:** A common term used to describe test doubles that simulate external services for SOA or microservices testing.
* **API Simulation/Mock:**  Doubles that specifically mimic the behavior of an API, allowing for controlled testing of service interactions.
* **HTTP Stub/Mock:** Similar to API mocks, but focused on simulating HTTP interactions.
* **Over-the-Wire Test Double:** A broader term encompassing any test double that interacts with the system under test over a network protocol.

**Verified Fake:**

A verified fake is a type of fake object whose behavior has been explicitly verified to closely resemble the real object. This verification is achieved through a separate set of tests that run against both the verified fake and the actual implementation. The goal is to ensure the fake object behaves similarly to the real object in the context of the specific test scenario.
## Test Doubles: Stubs vs Mocks

**Focus:**

* **Stubs:**  Stubs primarily focus on providing predictable outcomes during tests. They are designed to isolate the code under test from external dependencies by simulating pre-defined responses or behaviors.

* **Mocks:**  Mocks, on the other hand, emphasize verifying interactions between the application under test (AUT) and its dependencies. They record how the AUT interacts with the mock object, allowing you to validate if the correct methods were called with the expected arguments and in the desired order.

**Behavior:**

* **Stubs:**  Stubs are generally behavior-agnostic. They simply return pre-determined values or perform pre-defined actions without verifying how they are called. This makes them ideal for isolating the code's behavior when interacting with complex dependencies or external systems that are not relevant to the specific functionality being tested.

* **Mocks:**  Mocks are behavior-focused. You can define expectations about how they should be interacted with during the test. This includes specifying the expected method calls, arguments, and return values. Mocks can also be configured to throw exceptions for unexpected interactions, helping to ensure the robustness of your code.

**Example:**

* **Stub:** Imagine testing a function that retrieves data from a database. You could use a stub database that always returns a specific set of data, regardless of the query being executed. This allows you to focus on testing how your code processes the retrieved data without needing a real database connection.

* **Mock:** Consider testing a function that sends an email notification. A mock email service could be used to verify that the correct email content is being sent to the appropriate recipient. The mock wouldn't actually send an email, but it would record the attempted call and the provided arguments for verification.

**Choosing Between Stubs and Mocks:**

* Use stubs when you need to isolate your code's behavior and the specific interactions with dependencies are not relevant to the test case.

* Use mocks when you want to verify how your code interacts with its dependencies, ensuring they are called with the correct arguments and in the expected order. Mocks are also helpful for simulating error scenarios by throwing exceptions for unexpected interactions.

## Best Practices with Test Doubles

Effective use of test doubles can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of your unit testing process. Here are some key practices to keep in mind when creating and implementing test doubles:

* **Isolating Test Doubles:**
    * In general, avoid sharing the behavior of a test double between multiple tests. This can create dependencies between tests, making them brittle and prone to failures if the test double behavior changes. Each test should ideally have its own isolated test double instance to ensure independence and maintainability.

* **Sharing Fakes Strategically:**
    * Fakes, due to their focus on replicating functionality rather than specific interactions, can be an exception to the isolation rule.  If a fake object provides generic functionality relevant to multiple tests, it can be shared to reduce code duplication and ensure consistency in behavior across those tests.

* **Choosing the Right Tool for the Job:**
    * Don't fall into the trap of using the same type of test double for every scenario. Analyze your test case and select the most suitable double type (stub, mock, spy, or fake) based on your specific needs.

* **Stubbing Only What's Necessary:**
    * Focus on stubbing only the behavior that is essential for the current test.  Over-engineering stubs with unnecessary complexity can waste time and effort.  Keep your stubs simple and focused on simulating the interactions relevant to the test at hand.

* **Clear and Meaningful Names:**
    * Choose clear and descriptive names for your test doubles. This improves code readability and understanding, especially when dealing with multiple test doubles in a complex test suite.

* **Documenting Expectations (Mocks):**
    * When using mocks, clearly document the expected interactions within your tests. This enhances clarity and maintainability, making it easier to understand what the mock is supposed to do and how it should be interacted with.

* **Leveraging Mocking Frameworks:**
    * Take advantage of the capabilities offered by mocking frameworks. Many frameworks provide utilities for simplifying mock creation, configuration, and verification, streamlining the testing process.

* **Refactoring Stubs and Mocks:**
    * As your codebase evolves, revisit your test doubles regularly. Refactor stubs and mocks when necessary to ensure they continue to accurately reflect the behavior of the real components they represent.
