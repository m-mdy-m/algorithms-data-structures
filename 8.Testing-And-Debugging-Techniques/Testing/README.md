## Testing Techniques:**

* **Test Case Design:** Crafting a variety of inputs to comprehensively test your program's behavior.
* **Unit Testing:** Verifying the correctness of individual code units in isolation.
* **Integration Testing:** Ensuring different units work cohesively after being integrated.
* **System Testing:** Evaluating the entire system's functionality and user experience.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Confirming the system meets stakeholder or client requirements.
* **Performance Testing:** Assessing how the system performs under load (e.g., high user traffic).
* **Security Testing:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
* **Usability Testing:** Evaluating how easy and intuitive the system is to use for the target audience.
* **Mutation Testing:** Deliberately introducing errors into the code and checking if the tests detect them.
