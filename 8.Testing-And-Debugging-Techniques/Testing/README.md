## Testing Techniques:**

* **Test Case Design:** Crafting a variety of inputs to comprehensively test your program's behavior.
* **Unit Testing:** Verifying the correctness of individual code units in isolation.
* **Integration Testing:** Ensuring different units work cohesively after being integrated.
* **System Testing:** Evaluating the entire system's functionality and user experience.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Confirming the system meets stakeholder or client requirements.
* **Performance Testing:** Assessing how the system performs under load (e.g., high user traffic).
* **Security Testing:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
* **Usability Testing:** Evaluating how easy and intuitive the system is to use for the target audience.
* **Mutation Testing:** Deliberately introducing errors into the code and checking if the tests detect them.
* **Non-Functional Testing:** This category encompasses testing aspects beyond the core functionality, such as performance, usability, security (which you already have), and reliability.
* **API Testing:** If your application interacts with APIs (external or internal), there are specific techniques to ensure they function as expected.
* **GUI Testing (Graphical User Interface Testing):** This focuses on testing the visual elements and user interactions of a graphical application.
* **Smoke Testing:** A high-level test to validate basic functionality after a new build or major code change.
* **Regression Testing:** Re-running previously successful tests on modified code to ensure no regressions (unintended functionality breaks).
* **Exploratory Testing:** A more creative approach where the tester actively explores the application to find bugs.
