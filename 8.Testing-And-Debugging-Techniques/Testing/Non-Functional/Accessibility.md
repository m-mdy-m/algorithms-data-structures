# What is Accessibility Testing?
Accessibility testing is a type of usability testing that focuses on people with disabilities. The goal of accessibility testing is to ensure websites and web-based applications can be used by people with disabilities. Websites and web-based applications that adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are generally considered to be accessible. Created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), WCAG has become the global standard for web accessibility compliance, impacting web accessibility policies around the world.
**What is WCAG Compliance?** 
WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. It's a set of internationally recognized guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure web content is accessible to people with disabilities. These guidelines cover a wide range of aspects,  including visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. By following WCAG, developers and designers can create websites and web applications that are usable by everyone.

## WCAG's Role in Accessibility Testing: A Comprehensive Guide

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) play a central role in accessibility testing. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), WCAG provides a set of internationally recognized standards for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. 

Here's a deeper dive into WCAG's role in accessibility testing:

**WCAG as a Benchmark:**

* WCAG offers a structured framework with **testable criteria** that guide developers and designers in creating accessible websites and web applications. 
* These criteria address a wide range of disabilities, including visual impairments, hearing impairments, motor impairments, cognitive limitations, and speech disabilities. 
* WCAG compliance ensures content can be perceived, operated, understood, and navigated effectively by users with disabilities, adhering to the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust).

**WCAG Versions and Conformance Levels:**

* WCAG has evolved over time, with the current version being WCAG 2.2, released in October 2023. WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 remain relevant, but WCAG 2.2 incorporates advancements and addresses some limitations of the previous versions.
* Each WCAG version offers three conformance levels:
    * **Level A (Minimum):** Addresses foundational accessibility requirements, ensuring basic usability for users with disabilities. 
    * **Level AA (Recommended):** Expands on Level A, encompassing a wider range of accessibility needs and considered the recommended standard for most websites by regulations and guidelines worldwide.
    * **Level AAA (Strictest):**  Includes the most stringent criteria for enhanced accessibility across various disabilities. Level AAA conformance might be necessary for specific situations where maximum accessibility is crucial.

**WCAG and Accessibility Testing Practices:**

* Accessibility testing plays a vital role in verifying a website or application's conformance with WCAG guidelines. 
* The testing process involves:
    * **Manual Testing:** Human testers with disabilities or accessibility expertise evaluate the interface, identify potential barriers, and assess compliance with WCAG criteria. This user-centric approach provides valuable insights into real-world accessibility issues.
    * **Automated Testing:** Automated tools scan websites for common accessibility problems, offering quick feedback and efficiency. However, they may not uncover all issues and often require manual confirmation of results.

**Examples of WCAG Success Criteria:**

* **Ensuring compatibility with screen readers:** Websites need to be coded in a way that works with assistive technologies like JAWS and NVDA, allowing users with vision impairments to access information. 
* **Providing alternative text (alt text) for images:** Descriptive alt text conveys the meaning of images to screen reader users.
* **Maintaining proper color contrast:** Adequate color contrast between text and background ensures readability for users with visual impairments.
* **Adding captions and transcripts to videos:** Captions provide text description of video content, ensuring accessibility for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
* **Structuring content logically and consistently:** Logical content structure with clear headings and navigation aids users with cognitive disabilities in understanding and navigating the website.
* **Enabling keyboard navigation:**  Users with motor limitations should be able to navigate the website entirely using a keyboard.

## The accessibility testing process
The accessibility testing process can be conducted by website owners themselves, if they choose to do so. To that end, they can thoroughly review a website, online document, or any other relevant web-based application and inspect its level of conformance with relevant web accessibility standards. Given that the latter is a complex process, many website owners choose to rely on expert service providers to perform the accessibility testing process for them. Often, they will first rely on an automated tool to run a quick audit of their website to gauge their website’s overall level of accessibility. If the results indicate that the website suffers from gaps in accessibility, website owners will then turn to expert service providers to more thoroughly investigate these issues.

Accessibility testing for specific disability categories 
The goal of accessibility testing is to ensure that people with various disabilities can access a website or web-based application. Given that different disabilities present specific challenges when engaging with a website or web-based application, the testing process will need to account for such varying user experiences. To that end, most accessibility testing agencies divide disabilities into five major categories:


Low vision/Blindness
These range from complete blindness to more moderate vision impairments, such as low vision. Color blindness and poor eyesight are also vision impairments that accessibility testers check for. To test whether websites and web-based applications are accessible for people with these disabilities, testers should verify whether:

They are compatible with screen readers
There is sufficient color contrasts between text and its background
Text text can be resized to 200% without loss of content or function 
Important note: These are only a select few elements a tester will need to examine. The actual list of action items is much longer.


Physical disabilities 
A wide range of permanent and temporary disabilities can make it difficult to use a computer mouse. For people who have these disabilities to be able to access them, websites need to be configured so that they facilitate keyboard navigation. Testing whether websites and web-based applications are accessible for people with these disabilities, therefore entails examining whether they can be operated fully using only a keyboard.


Important note: These are only a select few elements a tester will need to examine. The actual list of action items is much longer.


Learning and cognitive disabilities
Developmental disabilities, learning disabilities, and brain injuries can make it hard for people to navigate complex web experiences. Additionally, people with learning disabilities can find reading and writing difficult. To test whether websites and web-based applications are accessible for people with these disabilities, testers should verify whether:

It is devoid of unnecessary jargon and complex terminology
It features content that is structured in a simple and intuitive way
Its web pages are designed so that they aren’t overly cluttered 
Important note: These are only a select few elements a tester will need to examine. The actual list of action items is much longer.


Hearing disabilities
Auditory problems span from total deafness to difficulty hearing quiet sounds. To test whether websites and web-based applications are accessible for people with these disabilities, testers should verify whether:

Videos feature captions
Audible alerts, such as for chat notifications, are provided in a visual format
Important note: These are only a select few elements a tester will need to examine. The actual list of action items is much longer.


## Who should perform Accessibility Testing?
To ensure digital experiences are inclusive and meet the needs of all users, it is important to have a combination of different teams involved in accessibility testing.

Product Managers:  They should ensure accessibility is considered in the product roadmap and allocate resources for testing and remediation.
Designers: It’s crucial to involve designers in the accessibility process to ensure that the UI and UX  are designed with accessibility as a key consideration. 
Testers:  Accessibility experts conduct in-depth evaluations of compliance with accessibility guidelines and report issues to developers. During functional testing, QA teams ensure accessibility principles are met by identifying common web accessibility issues.
