# What is usability testing?
Usability testing is a cornerstone of user-centered design, a research method that evaluates how easy and intuitive it is for users to interact with a website, app, or any other product. It provides invaluable insights for designers and product teams by directly observing real users as they attempt to complete specific tasks. 

Here's a breakdown of the usability testing process:

1. **Recruiting Participants:** The first step involves identifying and recruiting a group of participants that represent your target audience.  These users should not be familiar with the product being tested,  as you want to gauge their experience from a fresh perspective.

2. **Defining Tasks and Goals:**  Usability tests focus on specific tasks that users would typically perform when using your product.  These tasks should be clearly defined and aligned with the overall goals users are trying to achieve.

3. **Conducting the Test:**  Participants are presented with the product and asked to complete the designated tasks.  The session is usually moderated by a researcher who observes the user's actions, thought processes (often through verbal prompts), and any difficulties they encounter.  These sessions can be conducted in-person or remotely using screen recording tools. 

4. **Analysis and Reporting:**  Following the test, researchers analyze the data collected. This includes recording success rates in completing tasks, the time taken,  the paths users took to achieve their goals, and any comments or frustrations they expressed.  This analysis helps identify usability issues and areas for improvement.

5. **Iteration and Refinement:**  Based on the usability test findings, the product can be iterated upon and refined to address the identified issues.  This may involve changes in design, layout, functionality, or even the overall user flow.  New iterations can then be subjected to further usability testing to ensure ongoing improvement. 

## What Usability Testing Is Not

Before we dive into the specifics of usability testing, it's important to clear up some common misconceptions. User research, user testing, and usability testing are all terms frequently used in the design world, but they have distinct purposes.

**User research** is the broad umbrella term encompassing all activities that involve gathering feedback and insights from users to inform product decisions. Usability testing is a specific type of user research that focuses solely on evaluating a product or design's usability.

Here's a breakdown of some UX research methods that are **not** usability testing:

* **A/B Testing:** This statistical method compares and tests different design variations to see which ones users prefer and perform better. A/B testing is concerned with user preference and provides primarily quantitative data (numbers). Usability testing, on the other hand, focuses on user behavior and can provide both quantitative and qualitative data (observations and explanations).

* **Surveys:** Surveys are excellent tools for gathering data from a large pool of users or customers, typically using multiple-choice questions, sentiment ratings, or scales. While surveys can reveal how users feel about a product, they don't provide insights into how users interact with it.

* **Focus Groups:** A focus group session involves a moderator guiding a discussion and posing open-ended questions to encourage participants to share their opinions and experiences. The goal is to understand user attitudes and perceptions related to a specific topic. 

* **General User Testing:**  This is a broader term that can encompass various user research methods,  including usability testing.  However,  it can also refer to testing products and ideas with real users in a more general sense, often using quantitative methods to collect user feedback.  Unlike usability testing, it may not provide qualitative data on the reasons behind user struggles with tasks.

In essence, usability testing goes beyond simply collecting data on user preferences or general opinions. It delves deeper, observing user behavior and thought processes as they attempt to complete specific tasks within the product. This qualitative data is crucial for uncovering usability issues and understanding why users might encounter difficulties.
## Types of Usability Testing

Choosing the right usability testing method depends on the specific goals of your research.  Usability testing methods can be broadly categorized along three dimensions:

**1. Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data:**

Ideally, usability testing should gather  **both** qualitative and quantitative data to provide a well-rounded picture of the user experience.

* **Qualitative Usability Testing:**  This approach focuses on the "why" behind user behavior.  The goal is to understand users' thought processes, feelings, and experiences as they interact with the product.  Techniques like "think-aloud" studies, where users verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks,  are  used to gather qualitative data.  Observations, interviews, and surveys can also be valuable sources of qualitative insights.

* **Quantitative Usability Testing:**   Here, the focus is on collecting and analyzing measurable data  like success rates in completing tasks, time spent on tasks, error rates, and user satisfaction ratings.  Quantitative data allows researchers to identify patterns, make predictions, and generalize findings across a larger user population. 

**2. Moderated vs. Unmoderated Testing:**

This distinction refers to the presence or absence of a moderator during the test session.

* **Moderated Usability Testing:**  A moderator guides participants through the test, either in person or remotely.  The moderator can answer questions, ask follow-up inquiries, and record observations throughout the session. This approach allows for real-time interaction and clarification,  potentially leading to richer data.

* **Unmoderated Usability Testing:**  As the name implies, there's no moderator present.   Users complete tasks independently, typically using online tools that record their actions, screen interactions, and responses.  This method is often faster and more cost-effective  than moderated testing,  and allows users to complete tasks in their own environment, potentially revealing more natural behaviors.  However,  the lack of a moderator means researchers may miss out on  understanding the "why" behind user actions.

**3. Remote vs. In-Person Testing:**

The location of the usability test session can be determined by the type of product being tested and the research goals.

* **Remote Usability Testing:**  This method can be either moderated or unmoderated, and leverages online tools and software that allow users to share their screens, record their activity, and provide feedback.   The biggest advantage of remote testing is the flexibility - participants and researchers can be geographically dispersed. 

* **In-Person Usability Testing:**   This approach involves conducting the session in a physical location,  often a usability lab or dedicated research facility.   While it allows for closer observation and potentially richer data collection (e.g., observing body language), in-person testing can be more expensive, time-consuming, and limit the  geographic diversity and sample size  of participants.  For some products, however, in-person testing may be necessary.  This could be the case for products with safety considerations, requiring supervision during use, or involving physical interaction with the product.


Choosing the right type of usability testing depends on your specific needs and resources.  Consider the type of data you need (qualitative vs. quantitative), the level of guidance you want to provide to participants (moderated vs. unmoderated), and the logistical feasibility of in-person vs. remote testing. 
## 5 Key benefits of usability testing
1. **Reduce Development Costs:**  Catching usability problems early in the development cycle is significantly cheaper than fixing them after launch.  Usability testing allows you to identify areas where users struggle to navigate or complete tasks.  By addressing these issues proactively, you can avoid costly rework and delays down the line.

2. **Tailor Products to Your Users:**  As Behzod Sirjani, Founder of Yet Another Studio, points out, "We all have unique backgrounds, lived experiences, perspectives, preferences, and abilities."  These factors all influence how users  understand and interact with a product.  Usability testing bridges the gap between your assumptions and user reality.  By directly observing users and soliciting their feedback, you gain a deeper understanding of their needs and pain points.  This allows you to tailor the product to  better serve them and effectively solve their problems.

3. **Increase Accessibility:**  Usability testing isn't just about optimizing for the average user.  It's also about ensuring your product is accessible to a wider audience,  including people with disabilities.  While adhering to accessibility standards and regulations is crucial, usability testing with users who have diverse abilities and needs takes accessibility to the next level.  This inclusive approach not only benefits your product but also contributes to a more equitable digital landscape.

4. **Increase User Satisfaction and Brand Reputation:**   Usability testing is a cornerstone of creating a positive user experience.  As Taylor Palmer, Product Design Lead at Range, states, "Usability testing is one of the most fundamental ways to test the success of a product."  By identifying and addressing usability issues before launch, you can ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.  This translates to higher user satisfaction, a more loyal user base, and ultimately, a positive brand reputation.

5. **Combat Cognitive Biases:**  Our brains rely on cognitive shortcuts,  unconscious beliefs or assumptions, to make quick decisions.  While these shortcuts can be helpful, they can also lead to design decisions based on biases rather than actual user behavior.  Usability testing with real users helps to filter out these biases by providing objective feedback.  This ensures that your product is designed based on user needs  and authentic user behavior,  not on assumptions or the perspective of those already familiar with the product.
## When should you do usability testing?
Usability testing is not a one-time fix; it's an iterative process that should be conducted throughout the entire product lifecycle  to ensure your product remains relevant and addresses users' evolving needs.  Here's a breakdown of key points for when to integrate usability testing:

**Early and Often: A Departure from Traditional Thinking**

Traditionally, usability testing was viewed as a late-stage activity,  aimed at identifying bugs before launch.  However, this approach misses valuable opportunities to gather user insights and inform design decisions from the very beginning.  Usability testing should be embraced as a continuous process to  measure how usable your product is at various stages and  guide improvements for a more intuitive user experience.

**Key Stages for Usability Testing:**

1. **Before You Start Designing:**  Usability testing isn't limited to evaluating prototypes or finished products.  Early-stage research through surveys, competitor analysis, or even basic usability testing  can  uncover user needs, expectations, and potential pain points.  With this data in hand, you can  lay a strong foundation for user-centered design,  leading to a more intuitive product from the get-go.

2. **Once You Have a Wireframe or Prototype:**  Usability testing is highly applicable throughout the design process.  As Vaida Pakulyte, UX researcher and Designer at Electrolux, suggests, "I test at an early concept phase, and once we get the first results, we use them throughout other design phases and re-test with users."

Techniques like card sorting and tree testing can be used at this stage to  understand how users  categorize information and navigate your wireframe or prototype.  This allows you to identify potential navigation issues early on and ensure a user-friendly information architecture.

3. **Before Launching the Product:**  By the time you reach this stage, you likely have a functional (or almost-functional) product.  Here, summative testing comes into play to evaluate the overall effectiveness of your product.  This testing focuses on measuring how well the product performs against specific usability heuristics,  such as efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction.  Tasks used in the testing should represent real-world user scenarios to provide  actionable insights.

4. **At Regular Intervals After Launch:**  The product launch doesn't mark the end of the usability testing journey.  Regular testing  after launch is crucial to ensure the product remains user-friendly, accessible, and relevant as user needs and behaviors evolve.  Usability testing tools can be leveraged to conduct live website testing and identify issues arising from browser updates, third-party integrations, or changes in user behavior patterns.  By proactively addressing these issues, you can maintain a positive user experience and a competitive edge.
## How to Conduct Usability Testing

**1. Define Your Testing Goals and Target Audience:**

Usability testing  aims to create a product that users can easily understand and navigate.  To achieve this, you need to  identify your target audience.  Here are some key questions to ask yourself:

* What are the demographics of your ideal users (age, location, profession)?
* What specific tasks do you want users to be able to accomplish with your product (e.g., completing a purchase, managing their account settings)?
* What are your desired timeframes for users to complete tasks and navigate the interface?

Once you have a clear understanding of your target audience and their goals,  formulate a problem statement that outlines the specific insights you want to gain from the testing.  For example: "We want to assess how usable our mobile banking app is for  30-40 year old  professionals,  with the goal of them being able to transfer funds  within 60 seconds."  This focused approach will  guide you in selecting the most appropriate research methods and metrics to evaluate the user experience.

**2. Leverage Tools for Continuous Testing:**

Investing in a usability testing tool can streamline the process for your team.  These tools  facilitate frequent and scalable testing throughout the entire product development lifecycle,  including after launch.  This continuous approach allows you to gather ongoing user feedback,  stay up-to-date on evolving user needs,  and make data-driven decisions to retain users.  A tool like Maze provides functionalities  for various testing needs:

* Live Website Testing: Evaluate user interaction with your live website or web application.
* Prototype Testing: Integrate prototypes designed in tools like Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch, and InVision to validate design concepts early in the development phase.
* Usability Testing Templates: Utilize pre-built templates to save time and ensure your tests are designed to capture relevant user insights.

**3. Establish Evaluation Criteria:**

Defining clear evaluation criteria ensures your team focuses on the most impactful aspects of the user experience.  Here are some usability metrics to consider based on your testing goals:

* **Task completion rate:**  Measures the percentage of users who successfully complete assigned tasks.
* **Direct and indirect success:**  Distinguishes between users who complete tasks exactly as intended (direct success) and those who find alternative  workarounds (indirect success). 
* **Time-on-screen:**  Tracks the total time users spend on a particular screen or page.
* **Time-on-task:**  Measures the time it takes users to complete a specific task.
* **User satisfaction score:**  Captures user sentiment through surveys or rating scales.
* **Misclick rate:**  Tracks the number of unintended clicks users make while interacting with the interface.

For instance, to evaluate user accessibility during a checkout process, you might  analyze metrics like time to completion and overall success rate (percentage of successful purchases).  Establishing benchmark results using earlier prototypes or competitor products can provide a valuable reference point  to track user performance improvements over time.

**4. Craft a Clear and Concise Usability Testing Script:**

A well-structured usability testing script outlines the tasks participants will perform,  provides clear instructions, and includes questions to be asked.  This script serves as a roadmap for the test and allows you to identify potential problems or areas for improvement.  Refer to a dedicated chapter for a detailed walkthrough on creating effective usability tasks and scripts.

**5. Keep it Short and Sweet: Manage Test Length Effectively**

Shorter test durations are generally more effective in maintaining participant focus and gathering meaningful insights.  The ideal test length depends on factors such as product complexity, testing objectives, and participant engagement.  A typical usability test  ranges from 15-20 minutes with 5-10 tasks. 

**6. Run a Pilot Test to Refine Your Approach**

Conducting a pilot test with a small group allows you to refine your testing materials and approach before involving your target audience.  Ideally, the pilot participant  should be someone from within your organization but not directly involved in the project to avoid preconceived notions about the product's functionality.  Alternatively, you can recruit a small group that closely resembles your target users.the clarity and effectiveness of your testing script, tasks, instructions, chosen testing methods, tools, and testing environment.  Think of it as a usability test for your actual usability test.

**7. Recruit the Right Participants:**

As Nick Babich, Editor-in-Chief of UX Planet, emphasizes: "No matter how much time you spend on  ideation and prototyping your design solution, you should always test it with real people."  Your goal  is to recruit participants that accurately represent your target audience and  possess similar backgrounds, preferences, and experiences to your intended users. 

Here are three effective methods for recruiting participants:

* **Invite them directly:** Utilize popover invites strategically placed on your website or within your browser-based product. If you're using a tool like Maze for your testing, you can leverage In-Product Prompts to embed surveys, tasks, or recruit relevant participants directly within the product itself.

* **Recruit existing users:** If you're testing an existing product, you have a valuable resource readily available: your current user base. Tools like Reach can streamline this process by allowing you to create participant databases directly from your CRM, segment them based on relevant criteria, and send personalized email invitations to participate in usability testing.

* **Recruit from a panel:** Consider using participant recruitment services offered by Maze or other providers. These services offer access to diverse user panels with a global reach, giving you the ability to quickly find participants that meet your specific demographic and testing needs.

When recruiting participants, keep in mind their availability and willingness to dedicate time to the testing session. Screen participants based on your defined criteria to ensure they align with your target audience profile. Avoid recruiting individuals who wouldn't typically use your product to prevent skewed results.

**8. Create a Positive Testing Environment:**

Usability testing should foster open and honest feedback, resembling an interactive conversation rather than an interrogation. To achieve this, ensure your team is well-briefed on how to interact with participants and minimize bias. Researchers should avoid leading questions that might influence participant behavior.  It's crucial for each participant to feel comfortable providing their honest feedback, both positive and negative. 

Consider incorporating a reference video showcasing best practices for conducting usability testing sessions. This can equip your team with valuable techniques to create a positive and productive testing environment.

**9. Analyze and Report Your Findings:**

Transforming raw data and participant feedback into actionable insights is a critical step in the usability testing process. By analyzing this data, you can identify user pain points, prioritize improvements to the user experience (UX), and effectively communicate them within your team.

Here are some key metrics to track and analyze:

* **Usability metrics:** This includes data points like the total number of testers, bounce rate, misclick rate, and average test duration.

* **User journey analysis:** Track the paths participants took while interacting with your product. This can reveal inefficiencies in the user flow and highlight areas for optimization. Analyze these paths alongside an ideal or optimal path to identify discrepancies.

* **Success metrics:** Measure how many testers deviated from the intended flow while completing tasks. This can indicate areas where the product design might be confusing or require clearer direction.

* **Participant feedback:** Analyze responses to closed and open-ended questions. Consider utilizing visual representations of the responses to gain a deeper understanding of user sentiment and identify common themes.

**Product Tip:** Leverage reporting tools offered by your chosen usability testing platform (like Maze Reports) to download reports or integrate them  with your favorite  project management tools  such as Airtable, Coda, Confluence, FigJam, Jira Cloud, and Miro. This allows for seamless data visualization and collaboration within your team.

**10. Iterate and Repeat:**

Usability testing is an ongoing process, not a one-time event.  It's crucial to incorporate an iterative approach with feedback loops and revisions throughout the product lifecycle.  Use the insights gained from your tests to refine your design, then conduct follow-up tests to validate the effectiveness of the changes.  As your product and target audience evolve, you might need to  re-evaluate your usability testing process and adapt it to accommodate  new goals, user segments, and market conditions.
