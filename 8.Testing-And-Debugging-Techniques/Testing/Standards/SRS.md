# What is software requirements specification (SRS)

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a comprehensive document that defines the intended purpose, functionalities, and operational environment for a software program under development. It details what the software will do, how it will perform, and how it will interact with users, hardware, and other software.

An SRS serves as a critical roadmap for developers, minimizing development time and costs. A well-written SRS ensures clear communication and understanding of project goals, functionalities, and performance expectations. It also considers real-world usage scenarios, including factors like speed, response times, security, and error recovery. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has established guidelines for defining an SRS in its specification 830-1998.

## What is SRS Validation

SRS validation is a crucial step in the software development lifecycle that ensures the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) accurately reflects the needs of the project and its stakeholders. It's essentially a quality check to verify the SRS is:

- **Complete:** Does the SRS capture all the necessary functionalities, user interactions, and performance requirements? Are there any missing pieces that could lead to development issues later?
- **Consistent:** Are there any contradictions or inconsistencies within the SRS itself? Do the specified requirements align with each other and with any external project documentation?
- **Feasible:** Are the requirements outlined in the SRS realistic and achievable within the project's constraints (budget, timeline, technology)?
- **Unambiguous:** Is the SRS written clearly and concisely? Are there any ambiguous statements or terminology that could be misinterpreted by developers?
- **Verifiable:** Can the requirements in the SRS be objectively tested and measured to ensure the final software meets its intended purpose?

## Why Use an SRS Document?

- **Shared Vision and Alignment:** An SRS acts as a single source of truth, providing a clear and comprehensive picture of the entire project for all stakeholders. This includes developers, testers, product managers, and even those involved in future maintenance. By having a shared understanding of project goals, functionalities, and expectations, everyone works towards a common vision and avoids misunderstandings.
- **Improved Communication:** The SRS fosters clear communication throughout the development lifecycle. It facilitates discussions between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page about what the software will do and how it will function. This reduces ambiguity and minimizes the risk of misinterpretations later in development.
- **Reduced Development Risks and Costs:** A well-defined SRS helps identify and address potential issues early on. By outlining clear requirements, the SRS minimizes the risk of scope creep, rework, and costly delays during development. Additionally, it allows for more accurate project estimations and resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Quality and Maintainability:** An SRS serves as a blueprint for building high-quality software. By establishing clear expectations for functionalities, performance, and user interactions, the SRS ensures the final product aligns with stakeholder needs. Furthermore, a well-documented SRS simplifies future maintenance and updates, as developers have a clear reference point for understanding the software's purpose and functionalities.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** The SRS provides valuable insights for making informed decisions throughout the software's lifecycle. For example, a detailed analysis of functionalities in the SRS can help determine when to retire obsolete features or prioritize development efforts for new ones.

**Investment in Efficiency:** While creating a comprehensive SRS requires time and effort upfront, it's an investment in overall project efficiency. The clarity and direction provided by a well-written SRS leads to faster development times, reduced rework, and ultimately, a higher quality software product.

## Software Requirements Specification vs. System Requirements Specification

While the terms "software" and "system" are sometimes used interchangeably, there's a key distinction between a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and a System Requirements Specification (SyRS). Both documents play crucial roles in the development process, but they focus on different aspects:

**System Requirements Specification (SyRS):**

- **High-Level Overview:** A SyRS provides a broader perspective, outlining the overall requirements of a complete system. This system can encompass various components, including hardware, software, external interfaces, and even human resources or processes.
- **Business-Driven Focus:** The SyRS is derived from a thorough analysis of business needs. It defines the system's functionalities from a business standpoint, outlining how the system will contribute to achieving overall business objectives.
- **General Requirements:** The SyRS focuses on specifying general system requirements. This includes details like performance expectations, security needs, usability considerations, and compatibility requirements with existing systems.

**Software Requirements Specification (SRS):**

- **Software-Specific Focus:** An SRS dives deeper into the specifics of the software component within the larger system. It outlines the functionalities, features, and behavior expected from the software itself.
- **Detailed Description:** The SRS provides a detailed description of the software's functionalities, including user interactions, data handling, error handling, and performance requirements. It essentially translates the high-level system requirements into clear technical specifications for software developers.
- **Technical Language:** An SRS is typically written in a more technical language, using terminology that software developers can understand and translate into code.

**Analogy:**

Think of an SRS as the blueprint for a specific house within a larger development project. The SyRS would represent the overall development plan for the entire neighborhood, outlining the types of houses (single-family, apartments, etc.), infrastructure needs (roads, utilities), and overall aesthetic of the community. The SRS focuses on the specific details and functionalities of a single house, while the SyRS provides the broader context for how that house fits into the bigger picture.

**In Summary:**

- A SyRS defines what the overall system needs to do to achieve business goals.
- An SRS details how the software component will fulfill its role within the system, providing a technical roadmap for development.

## How to Write an SRS Document
A well-crafted Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is essential for the success of any software development project.  It serves as a roadmap for developers, outlining the functionalities, features, and  behavioral expectations of the software being built.  Creating a clear and comprehensive SRS can be challenging, but the time invested in this upfront planning phase pays off in the long run by reducing development risks, improving communication, and ultimately delivering a high-quality software product.

Here's a step-by-step guide to writing an effective SRS document:

### 1. Define the Purpose With an Outline (Or Use an SRS Template)

The first step in crafting a well-structured Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to establish a clear roadmap. This roadmap takes the form of an outline that defines the key sections and information to be included in the SRS. Here are two approaches for creating this outline:

* **Developing Your Own Outline:**  This approach allows you to tailor the structure to the specific needs of your project.  A common outline used for SRS documents includes the following sections:

    * **Introduction:**
        * **1.1 Purpose:** Clearly define the reason for developing the software. What problem does it solve, or what need does it fulfill?
        * **1.2 Intended Audience:** Identify who will be using the SRS document. This typically includes developers, testers, project managers, and potentially stakeholders from other departments (leadership, sales, marketing). Understanding the audience ensures the SRS is written in a way that caters to their needs and level of technical expertise. 
        * **1.3 Intended Use:** Explain how the SRS will be used throughout the development lifecycle. Will it be a reference point for developers, a communication tool for stakeholders, or both? 
        * **1.4 Product Scope:** Define the boundaries of the software project. What functionalities are included, and what are explicitly excluded?  
        * **1.5 Definitions and Acronyms:**  Provide clear definitions for all key terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used within the SRS. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures everyone has a consistent understanding of the terminology.

    * **Overall Description:**
        * **2.1 User Needs:**  Analyze the needs of the various user groups who will interact with the software. What are their tasks, goals, and expectations? 
        * **2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies:**  Identify any underlying assumptions made during the planning process. Additionally, list any external dependencies the project has on other software, hardware, or resources. 

    * **System Features and Requirements:**
        * **3.1 Functional Requirements:**  Detail the specific functionalities the software must provide. This is the core of the SRS and defines what the software will do.
        * **3.2 External Interface Requirements:**  Outline how the software will interact with external components like hardware, other software programs, or user interfaces. 
        * **3.3 System Features:**  Describe the essential features the software needs to possess in order to function effectively.
        * **3.4 Non-Functional Requirements:**  Specify the qualities of the software beyond its core functionalities. This includes aspects like performance, security, usability, and scalability.

### 2. Define Your Product’s Purpose

The introduction section of your SRS document plays a critical role in setting expectations for all stakeholders involved in the project.  Here, you'll clearly define the purpose of the software being developed and how the SRS will be used. 

This step focuses on three key elements:

* **Identifying the Audience:** 
    * Who will be using the SRS document? This typically includes:
        * **Development Team:**  Developers, programmers, and engineers who will build the software based on the outlined requirements.
        * **Testing Team:**  Quality Assurance (QA) specialists who will test the software against the defined requirements to ensure functionality and identify any bugs.
        * **Project Managers:**  Individuals overseeing the development process, managing resources, and tracking progress.
    * The audience may also extend beyond the development team to include stakeholders from other departments, such as:
        * **Leadership Teams:**  Executives or managers who need to understand the project's goals and impact on the organization.
        * **Sales & Marketing Teams:**  Individuals who may use the SRS to understand the software's features and benefits for marketing and sales purposes.
    * By clearly defining the intended audience upfront, you can tailor the language and level of detail in the SRS to best suit their needs and understanding of technical concepts.

* **Specifying the Intended Use:**
    * How will the SRS be used throughout the development lifecycle?  Here are some common use cases:
        * **Development Roadmap:**  The SRS serves as a blueprint for developers, outlining the functionalities, features, and technical specifications they need to implement.
        * **Testing Reference:**  The SRS provides a clear set of criteria for the testing team to evaluate the software's performance and ensure it meets all the defined requirements.
        * **Communication Tool:**  The SRS facilitates communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. It provides a shared understanding of the project's goals and functionalities.

* **Defining the Product Scope:**
    * Establish the boundaries of the software project.  This involves outlining:
        * **Included Functionalities:**  Clearly define what the software will do and what features it will offer.
        * **Excluded Functionalities:**  Specify any functionalities that are explicitly outside the scope of the current project. This helps manage expectations and avoids scope creep during development.

* **Ensuring Clarity with Definitions:**
    * To eliminate ambiguity and ensure everyone has a consistent understanding of the document, clearly define all key terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used throughout the SRS. 
    * For projects with a large volume of industry-specific terminology or complex acronyms, consider including a reference to a separate project glossary that can be appended to the SRS. This glossary can provide more detailed explanations of these terms for easy reference

### 3. Describe What You Will Build

This step dives deeper into the specifics of the software being developed.  By clearly describing what you're building and the context surrounding it, you ensure your team is aligned on the project's goals and potential challenges. Here's a breakdown of the key elements to consider:

* **Understanding the Need:**

    * **Why is this product needed?**  Clearly define the problem the software aims to solve or the need it fulfills. This provides context and helps stakeholders understand the value proposition of the product.
    * **Who is the target user?** Identify the primary and secondary users who will interact with the software.  Consider their roles within the organization and how they will utilize the software. 
    * **Is this a new product, an add-on, or an integration?**  Specify whether you're building a standalone product, an extension to an existing product, or a software component that integrates with another system. 

* **User Needs Analysis:**

    * **User Personas:**  Develop user personas that represent the different user groups who will interact with the software.  These personas should detail:
        * User demographics (age, technical expertise, etc.)
        * Their specific tasks and goals when using the software
        * The needs and expectations they have for the software functionality

    * **Understanding the End User:**  Identify the end user of the software.  In some cases, the end user might be different from the purchaser (e.g., medical devices).  Understanding their needs is crucial for ensuring the software effectively addresses their problems.

* **Assumptions and Dependencies:**

    * **Technical Assumptions:**  List any underlying assumptions made about the technology stack or development environment.  For example, are you assuming the use of current technology or a specific framework (e.g., Windows)?  Explicitly stating these assumptions helps identify potential limitations or areas where further investigation might be needed.
    * **External Dependencies:**  Identify any external factors that the project relies on.  This could include reusing code from a previous project, integrating with external systems, or depending on specific hardware configurations.  By outlining these dependencies, you can proactively address potential risks and ensure all necessary resources are available.

### 4. Detail Your Specific Requirements

This step is crucial for ensuring the development team translates your vision into a functional software product. It involves meticulously detailing the specific requirements the software must fulfill. While the amount of detail might seem daunting, categorizing these requirements makes the process more manageable. Here's a breakdown of the common categories and considerations for each:

**1. Functional Requirements:**

The core of your SRS document, functional requirements define the specific actions and functionalities the software must perform.  These functionalities directly contribute to achieving the overall purpose of the software. Here are some strategies for detailing functional requirements:

* **Focus on Functionality:** Ask yourself questions like: "Does this add a new feature?" or "What function does this provide?"  By focusing on the functionalities delivered, you ensure a clear understanding of what the software will do.
* **Domain-Specific Considerations:**  In some industries, like medical devices, functional requirements might have a sub-set of specific requirements based on regulations and domain knowledge.  Ensure these domain-specific functionalities are clearly outlined.

**2. External Interface Requirements:**

A specialized type of functional requirement, external interface requirements detail how the software interacts with external components.  This is particularly important for embedded systems that integrate with other hardware or software.  Here are some common types of external interfaces to consider:

* **User Interface (UI):** How will users interact with the software? Define the functionalities and behavior expected from the user interface. 
* **Hardware Interface:** Does the software interact with any specific hardware devices? Outline the communication protocols and data exchange mechanisms between the software and the hardware.
* **Software Interface:** Will the software integrate with other software programs? Specify the data exchange formats, communication protocols, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) used for this integration.
* **Communication Interface:** Does the software need to communicate over networks or external channels? Define the communication protocols and data formats used for this external communication.

**3. System Features:**

Essentially a subset of functional requirements, system features represent essential functionalities the software must possess to operate effectively.  These features are core building blocks that enable the software to deliver its intended purpose. 

**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

While functional requirements define what the software does, non-functional requirements define how the software does it.  These  characteristics ensure the software operates in a way that meets user expectations and adheres to industry standards. Here are some common types of non-functional requirements to consider, along with their significance in different industries:

* **Performance Requirements:**  Define performance expectations such as speed, response time, and resource utilization (memory, CPU). These are particularly important for real-time systems or applications handling large amounts of data.
* **Safety Requirements:**  Critical for industries like medical devices and automotive, safety requirements outline measures to prevent harm or mitigate risks associated with software malfunctions. 
* **Security Requirements:**  Define security measures to protect the software from unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. The importance of security requirements varies depending on the sensitivity of the data the software handles.
* **Usability Requirements:**  Focus on how easy and intuitive the software is to use.  This includes aspects like user interface design, learnability, and user experience.
* **Scalability Requirements:**  Consider how the software will adapt to accommodate future growth in data volume, user base, or functionality.  Scalability requirements ensure the software can handle increased demands without performance degradation.

**The Importance of Prioritization:**

While all these requirements are important, they might not hold equal weight in every project.  Depending on the industry and specific use case, certain requirements might take priority.  For example, safety requirements are paramount in medical devices, while performance might be a top priority for trading platforms.  During this step, it's essential to prioritize the requirements based on project goals and potential risks.

### 5. Deliver for Approval
Congratulations! You've reached the final step of crafting your SRS document.  Now it's time to secure approval from key stakeholders and finalize the document for use throughout the development process.

**The Review Process:**

* **Stakeholder Involvement:** Distribute the SRS document to all relevant stakeholders for review. This typically includes:
    * Development Team: Developers, programmers, and engineers who will build the software based on the outlined requirements. 
    * Testing Team: Quality Assurance (QA) specialists who will ensure the software meets the defined requirements through testing.
    * Project Managers: Individuals overseeing the development process, managing resources, and tracking progress.
    * Additional Stakeholders (Optional): Depending on the project, other stakeholders from departments like leadership teams, sales, or marketing might also be involved in the review process.

* **Gathering Feedback:** Encourage reviewers to provide constructive feedback on the clarity, completeness, and accuracy of the document.  This feedback is crucial for identifying any ambiguities, missing information, or areas that need further clarification. 

* **Revisions and Iteration:**  Based on the feedback received, revise the SRS document to address any raised concerns.  This might involve clarifying specific requirements, adding missing information, or adjusting the technical language for better understandability.  

**Securing Approval:**

* **Formal Sign-Off:** Once all feedback has been incorporated and the document is deemed final, seek formal approval from key stakeholders. This might involve sign-offs from department heads, project leaders, or any other individuals with decision-making authority over the project.

**Finalizing the Document:**

* **Document Storage:** After securing approval, store the final version of the SRS document in a central and accessible location. This could be a shared document management system, a project management tool, or a version control system.  Easy access ensures all team members can refer to the document throughout the development lifecycle.

* **Reference Point:** The finalized SRS becomes a central reference point for the development team. Developers can use it to understand the functionalities and features to build. Testers can leverage it to design test cases that ensure the software meets all the outlined requirements. Project managers can utilize it to track progress and ensure the project stays aligned with the defined goals.

### Example: 

## Writing an SRS in Microsoft Word vs. Requirement Software

You can write your software requirement specification in Microsoft Word. A smart way to do this is to create an SRS template that you can use as a starting point for every project.

However, even with a template, writing an SRS this way can be a painstaking process. And if a requirement changes, your SRS can quickly fall out-of-date. Plus, there can be versioning issues with requirements documents that are written in Word.

Why is this an issue? Well, if you discover too late that your engineering teams have been working from an older version of your requirements, you may end up needing a lot of rework to re-align the product with the current requirements. And that rework result in waste of resources and development delays.

You can save time — and ensure product quality — by writing and maintaining your SRS in a dedicated requirements management tool like Helix ALM instead.

## Key components of an SRS

The main sections of a software requirements specification are:

Business drivers – this section describes the reasons the customer is looking to build the system, including problems with the currently system and opportunities the new system will provide.
Business model – this section describes the business model of the customer that the system has to support, including organizational, business context, main business functions and process flow diagrams.
Business/functional and system requirements -- this section typically consists of requirements that are organized in a hierarchical structure. The business/Functional requirements are at the top level and the detailed system requirements are listed as child items.
Business and system use cases -- this section consists of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case diagram depicting the key external entities that will be interacting with the system and the different use cases that they’ll have to perform.
Technical requirements -- this section lists the non-functional requirements that make up the technical environment where software needs to operate and the technical restrictions under which it needs to operate.  
System qualities -- this section is used to describe the non-functional requirements that define the quality attributes of the system, such as reliability, serviceability, security, scalability, availability and maintainability.
Constraints and assumptions -- this section includes any constraints that the customer has imposed on the system design. It also includes the requirements engineering team’s assumptions about what is expected to happen during the project.
Acceptance criteria -- this section details the conditions that must be met for the customer to accept the final system.

## Purpose of an SRS

An SRS forms the basis of an organization’s entire project. It sets out the framework that all the development teams will follow. It provides critical information to all the teams, including development, operations, quality assurance (QA) and maintenance, ensuring the teams are in agreement.

Using the SRS helps an enterprise confirm that the requirements are fulfilled and helps business leaders make decisions about the lifecycle of their product, such as when to retire a feature.

In addition, writing an SRS can help developers reduce the time and effort necessary to meet their goals as well as save money on the cost of development.

## Features of an SRS

An SRS should have following characteristics:

Correct -- should accurately reflect product functionality and specification at any point of time.
Unambiguous -- should not be any confusion regarding interpretation of the requirements.
Complete -- should contain all the features requested by a client.
Consistent -- same abbreviation and conventions must be followed throughout the document.
Ranked for importance and/or stability -- every requirement is important. But some are urgent and must be fulfilled before other requirements and some could be delayed. It’s better to classify each requirement according to its importance and stability.
Verifiable -- an SRS is verifiable only if every stated requirement can be verified. A requirement is verifiable if there is some method to quantifiably measure whether the final software meets that requirement.
Modifiable -- an SRS must clearly identify each and every requirement in a systematic manner. If there are any changes, the specific requirements and the dependent ones can be modified accordingly without impact the others.
Traceable – an SRS is traceable if the origin of each of its requirements is clear and if it makes it easy to reference each requirement in future development.

## The goals of an SRS

Some of the goals an SRS should achieve are to:

Provide feedback to the customer, ensuring that the IT company understands the issues the software system should solve and how to address those issues.
Help to break a problem down into smaller components just by writing down the requirements.
Speed up the testing and validation processes.
Facilitate reviews.
