# What is software requirements specification (SRS)
A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a comprehensive document that defines the intended purpose, functionalities, and operational environment for a software program under development.  It details what the software will do, how it will perform, and how it will interact with users, hardware, and other software. 

An SRS serves as a critical roadmap for developers, minimizing development time and costs.  A well-written SRS ensures clear communication and understanding of project goals, functionalities, and performance expectations.  It also considers real-world usage scenarios,  including factors like speed, response times, security, and error recovery.  The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has established guidelines for defining an SRS in its specification 830-1998. 

## What is SRS Validation
SRS validation is a crucial step in the software development lifecycle that ensures the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) accurately reflects the needs of the project and its stakeholders. It's essentially a quality check to verify the SRS is:

* **Complete:**  Does the SRS capture all the necessary functionalities, user interactions, and performance requirements? Are there any missing pieces that could lead to development issues later?
* **Consistent:**  Are there any contradictions or inconsistencies within the SRS itself? Do the specified requirements align with each other and with any external project documentation?
* **Feasible:**  Are the requirements outlined in the SRS realistic and achievable within the project's constraints (budget, timeline, technology)?
* **Unambiguous:**  Is the SRS written clearly and concisely? Are there any ambiguous statements or terminology that could be misinterpreted by developers?
* **Verifiable:**  Can the requirements in the SRS be objectively tested and measured to ensure the final software meets its intended purpose?

## Why Use an SRS Document?
* **Shared Vision and Alignment:**  An SRS acts as a single source of truth, providing a clear and comprehensive picture of the entire project for all stakeholders.  This includes developers, testers, product managers, and even those involved in future maintenance.  By having a shared understanding of project goals, functionalities, and expectations, everyone works towards a common vision and avoids misunderstandings.
* **Improved Communication:**  The SRS fosters clear communication throughout the development lifecycle.  It facilitates discussions between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page about what the software will do and how it will function. This reduces ambiguity and minimizes the risk of misinterpretations later in development.
* **Reduced Development Risks and Costs:**  A well-defined SRS helps identify and address potential issues early on.  By outlining clear requirements, the SRS minimizes the risk of scope creep, rework, and costly delays during development.  Additionally, it allows for more accurate project estimations and resource allocation.
* **Enhanced Quality and Maintainability:**  An SRS serves as a blueprint for building high-quality software.  By establishing clear expectations for functionalities, performance, and user interactions, the SRS ensures the final product aligns with stakeholder needs.  Furthermore, a well-documented SRS simplifies future maintenance and updates, as developers have a clear reference point for understanding the software's purpose and functionalities.
* **Informed Decision-Making:**  The SRS provides valuable insights for making informed decisions throughout the software's lifecycle.  For example, a detailed analysis of functionalities in the SRS can help determine when to retire obsolete features or prioritize development efforts for new ones. 

**Investment in Efficiency:**  While creating a comprehensive SRS requires time and effort upfront, it's an investment in overall project efficiency.  The clarity and direction provided by a well-written SRS leads to faster development times, reduced rework, and ultimately, a higher quality software product.

## Software Requirements Specification vs. System Requirements Specification
While the terms "software" and "system" are sometimes used interchangeably, there's a key distinction between a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and a System Requirements Specification (SyRS). Both documents play crucial roles in the development process, but they focus on different aspects:

**System Requirements Specification (SyRS):**

* **High-Level Overview:** A SyRS provides a broader perspective, outlining the overall requirements of a complete system. This system can encompass various components, including hardware, software, external interfaces, and even human resources or processes.
* **Business-Driven Focus:**  The SyRS is derived from a thorough analysis of business needs. It defines the system's functionalities from a business standpoint, outlining how the system will contribute to achieving overall business objectives.
* **General Requirements:**  The SyRS focuses on specifying general system requirements. This includes details like performance expectations, security needs, usability considerations, and compatibility requirements with existing systems.

**Software Requirements Specification (SRS):**

* **Software-Specific Focus:**  An SRS dives deeper into the specifics of the software component within the larger system. It outlines the functionalities, features, and behavior expected from the software itself.
* **Detailed Description:**  The SRS provides a detailed description of the software's functionalities, including user interactions, data handling, error handling, and performance requirements. It essentially translates the high-level system requirements into clear technical specifications for software developers.
* **Technical Language:**  An SRS is typically written in a more technical language, using terminology that software developers can understand and translate into code. 

**Analogy:**

Think of an SRS as the blueprint for a specific house within a larger development project. The SyRS would represent the overall development plan for the entire neighborhood, outlining the types of houses (single-family, apartments, etc.), infrastructure needs (roads, utilities), and overall aesthetic of the community. The SRS focuses on the specific details and functionalities of a single house,  while the SyRS provides the broader context for how that house fits into the bigger picture.

**In Summary:**

* A SyRS defines what the overall system needs to do to achieve business goals. 
* An SRS details how the software component will fulfill its role within the system,  providing a technical roadmap for development.

## How to Write an SRS Document
Creating a clear and effective SRS document can be difficult and time-consuming. But it is critical to the efficient development of a high quality product that meets the needs of business users. 

Here are five steps you can follow to write an effective SRS document.

1. Define the Purpose With an Outline (Or Use an SRS Template)
Your first step is to create an outline for your software requirements specification. This may be something you create yourself, or you can use an existing SRS template.

If you’re creating the outline yourself, here’s what it might look like:

1. Introduction

           1.1 Purpose

           1.2 Intended Audience

           1.3 Intended Use

           1.4 Product Scope

           1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

2. Overall Description

           2.1 User Needs

           2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

3. System Features and Requirements

            3.1 Functional Requirements

            3.2 External Interface Requirements

            3.3 System Features

            3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements

This is a basic outline and yours may contain more (or fewer) items. Now that you have an outline, lets fill in the blanks.


2. Define your Product’s Purpose
This introduction is very important as it sets expectations that we will come back to throughout the SRS. 

Some items to keep in mind when defining this purpose include:

Intended Audience and Intended Use
Define who in your organization will have access to the SRS and how they should use it. This may include developers, testers, and project managers. It could also include stakeholders in other departments, including leadership teams, sales, and marketing. Defining this now will lead to less work in the future.

Product Scope
What are the benefits, objectives, and goals we intend to have for this product? This should relate to overall business goals, especially if teams outside of development will have access to the SRS.

Definitions and Acronyms
Clearly define all key terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the SRS. This will help eliminate any ambiguity and ensure that all parties can easily understand the document.

If your project contains a large quantity of industry-specific or ambiguous terminology or acronyms, you may want to consider including a reference to a project glossary, to be appended to the SRS, in this section.

3. Describe What You Will Build
Your next step is to give a description of what you’re going to build. Why is this product needed? Who is it for? Is it a new product? Is it an add-on to a product you’ve already created? Is this going to integrate with another product?

Understanding and getting your team aligned on the answers to these questions on the front end makes creating the product much easier and more efficient for everyone involved.

User Needs
Describe who will use the product and how. Understanding the various users of the product and their needs is a critical part of the SRS writing process.

Who will be using the product? Are they a primary or secondary user? What is their role within their organization?  What need does the product need to fulfill for them?

Do you need to know about the purchaser of the product as well as the end user? For the development of medical devices and med device software, you may also need to know the needs of the patient.

Assumptions and Dependencies
What are we assuming will be true? Understating and laying out these assumptions ahead of time will help with headaches later. Are we assuming current technology? Are we basing this on a Windows framework?  We need to take stock of these technical assumptions to better understand where our product might fail or not operate perfectly.

Finally, you should note if your project is dependent on any external factors. Are we reusing a bit of software from a previous project? This new project would then depend on that operating correctly and should be included.

4. Detail Your Specific Requirements
In order for your development team to meet the requirements properly, we must include as much detail as possible. This can feel overwhelming but becomes easier as you break down your requirements into categories. Some common categories are functional requirements, interface requirements, system features, and various types of nonfunctional requirements:

Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are essential to your product because, as the name implies, they provide some sort of functionality.

Asking yourself questions such as “does this add to my tool’s functionality?” or “what function does this provide?” can help with this process. Within medical devices especially, these functional requirements may have a subset of domain-specific requirements.

You may also have requirements that outline how your software will interact with other tools, which brings us to external interface requirements. 

External Interface Requirements
External interface requirements are specific types of functional requirements. These are especially important when working with embedded systems. They outline how your product will interface with other components.

There are several types of interfaces you may have requirements for, including:

User
Hardware
Software
Communications
System Features
System features are a type of functional requirements. These are features that are required in order for a system to function.

Nonfunctional Requirements
Nonfunctional requirements, which help ensure that a product will work the way users and other stakeholders expect it to, can be just as important as functional ones.

These may include:

Performance requirements
Safety requirements
Security requirements
Usability requirements
Scalability requirements
The importance of each of these types of nonfunctional requirements may vary depending on your industry. In industries such as medical device, life sciences, and automotive, there are often regulations that require the tracking and accounting of safety. 

IEEE provides guidance for writing software requirements specifications, if you’re a member.

5. Deliver for Approval
We made it! After completing the SRS, you’ll need to get it approved by key stakeholders. This will require everyone to review the latest version of the document.
## Writing an SRS in Microsoft Word vs. Requirement Software
You can write your software requirement specification in Microsoft Word. A smart way to do this is to create an SRS template that you can use as a starting point for every project.

However, even with a template, writing an SRS this way can be a painstaking process. And if a requirement changes, your SRS can quickly fall out-of-date. Plus, there can be versioning issues with requirements documents that are written in Word.

Why is this an issue? Well, if you discover too late that your engineering teams have been working from an older version of your requirements, you may end up needing a lot of rework to re-align the product with the current requirements. And that rework result in waste of resources and development delays.

You can save time — and ensure product quality — by writing and maintaining your SRS in a dedicated requirements management tool like Helix ALM instead.

## Key components of an SRS
The main sections of a software requirements specification are:

Business drivers – this section describes the reasons the customer is looking to build the system, including problems with the currently system and opportunities the new system will provide.
Business model – this section describes the business model of the customer that the system has to support, including organizational, business context, main business functions and process flow diagrams.
Business/functional and system requirements -- this section typically consists of requirements that are organized in a hierarchical structure. The business/Functional requirements are at the top level and the detailed system requirements are listed as child items.
Business and system use cases -- this section consists of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case diagram depicting the key external entities that will be interacting with the system and the different use cases that they’ll have to perform.
Technical requirements -- this section lists the non-functional requirements that make up the technical environment where software needs to operate and the technical restrictions under which it needs to operate.  
System qualities -- this section is used to describe the non-functional requirements that define the quality attributes of the system, such as reliability, serviceability, security, scalability, availability and maintainability.
Constraints and assumptions -- this section includes any constraints that the customer has imposed on the system design. It also includes the requirements engineering team’s assumptions about what is expected to happen during the project.
Acceptance criteria -- this section details the conditions that must be met for the customer to accept the final system.

## Purpose of an SRS
An SRS forms the basis of an organization’s entire project. It sets out the framework that all the development teams will follow. It provides critical information to all the teams, including development, operations, quality assurance (QA) and maintenance, ensuring the teams are in agreement.

Using the SRS helps an enterprise confirm that the requirements are fulfilled and helps business leaders make decisions about the lifecycle of their product, such as when to retire a feature. 

In addition, writing an SRS can help developers reduce the time and effort necessary to meet their goals as well as save money on the cost of development.
## Features of an SRS
An SRS should have following characteristics:

Correct -- should accurately reflect product functionality and specification at any point of time.
Unambiguous -- should not be any confusion regarding interpretation of the requirements.
Complete -- should contain all the features requested by a client.
Consistent -- same abbreviation and conventions must be followed throughout the document.
Ranked for importance and/or stability -- every requirement is important. But some are urgent and must be fulfilled before other requirements and some could be delayed. It’s better to classify each requirement according to its importance and stability.
Verifiable -- an SRS is verifiable only if every stated requirement can be verified. A requirement is verifiable if there is some method to quantifiably measure whether the final software meets that requirement.
Modifiable -- an SRS must clearly identify each and every requirement in a systematic manner. If there are any changes, the specific requirements and the dependent ones can be modified accordingly without impact the others.
Traceable – an SRS is traceable if the origin of each of its requirements is clear and if it makes it easy to reference each requirement in future development.


## The goals of an SRS
Some of the goals an SRS should achieve are to:

Provide feedback to the customer, ensuring that the IT company understands the issues the software system should solve and how to address those issues.
Help to break a problem down into smaller components just by writing down the requirements.
Speed up the testing and validation processes.
Facilitate reviews.
