## Testing Techniques:**

* **Test Case Design:** Crafting a variety of inputs to comprehensively test your program's behavior.
* **Unit Testing:** Verifying the correctness of individual code units in isolation.
* **Integration Testing:** Ensuring different units work cohesively after being integrated.
* **System Testing:** Evaluating the entire system's functionality and user experience.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Confirming the system meets stakeholder or client requirements.
* **Performance Testing:** Assessing how the system performs under load (e.g., high user traffic).
* **Security Testing:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
* **Usability Testing:** Evaluating how easy and intuitive the system is to use for the target audience.
* **Mutation Testing:** Deliberately introducing errors into the code and checking if the tests detect them.

## Debugging Techniques:**

* **Logging:** Printing informative messages to track code execution and identify issues.
* **Print Statements:** Using temporary statements to examine variable values during debugging.
* **Debuggers:** Leveraging IDE debuggers to step through code line by line and inspect variables.
* **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Talking through your code to an imaginary listener to uncover flaws.
* **Code Reviews:** Gaining a fresh perspective on your code through peer review.
* **Version Control Systems (VCS):** Tracking code changes and reverting to previous versions if necessary.
* **Static Code Analysis:** Using automated tools to identify potential errors and code smells (areas needing improvement) without running the code.
* **Profiling:** Analyzing how the program uses resources (CPU, memory) to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

## Additional Tips:**

* **Defensive Programming:** Writing code that anticipates and handles potential errors gracefully.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests first to promote a test-centric approach and catch errors early.
* **Exception Handling:** Implementing mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected errors during program execution.
* **Pair Programming:** Two programmers working together on the same code, promoting collaboration and early detection of issues.
