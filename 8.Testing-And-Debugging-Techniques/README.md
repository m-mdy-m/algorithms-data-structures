## Additional Tips:**

* **Defensive Programming:** Writing code that anticipates and handles potential errors gracefully.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests first to promote a test-centric approach and catch errors early.
* **Exception Handling:** Implementing mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected errors during program execution.
* **Pair Programming:** Two programmers working together on the same code, promoting collaboration and early detection of issues.
