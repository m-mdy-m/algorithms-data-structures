## Debugging Techniques:**

* **Logging:** Printing informative messages to track code execution and identify issues.
* **Print Statements:** Using temporary statements to examine variable values during debugging.
* **Debuggers:** Leveraging IDE debuggers to step through code line by line and inspect variables.
* **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Talking through your code to an imaginary listener to uncover flaws.
* **Code Reviews:** Gaining a fresh perspective on your code through peer review.
* **Version Control Systems (VCS):** Tracking code changes and reverting to previous versions if necessary.
* **Static Code Analysis:** Using automated tools to identify potential errors and code smells (areas needing improvement) without running the code.
* **Profiling:** Analyzing how the program uses resources (CPU, memory) to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
