# Constructors And Destructors

## What is Constructors

In class-based, object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) is a special type of function called when a new instance of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the newly created object and prepare it for use.

A constructor resembles an instance method but differs in several ways:

- It has no explicit return type.
- It is not inherited by subclasses.

Constructors typically initialize the object's data members and establish the class's invariant, ensuring that the object is in a valid state upon creation. Immutable objects, in particular, must be initialized within the constructor.

Languages commonly allow constructor overloading, meaning a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. This enables flexibility in object creation.

Some languages provide special types of constructors. For instance, factory methods or factory classes abstract object creation and can provide alternative ways of creating objects, potentially involving multiple classes or different allocation schemes.

### Summary:

Constructors are special functions invoked when creating a new instance of a class. They initialize the object, set its initial state, and ensure it is valid for use. Constructors can be overloaded to provide different initialization options, and they are essential for proper object initialization and maintenance of class invariants.

## Types

### Parameterized constructors

Parameterized constructors are constructors that can take at least one argument. When an object is created using a parameterized constructor, initial values must be passed as arguments to the constructor function. The usual method of object declaration may not work in this case.
Parameterized constructors can be called either explicitly or implicitly. The implicit method of calling the constructor is also known as the shorthand method.

#### Example :
```JavaScript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

// Creating objects using parameterized constructor
let person1 = new Person("Alex", 19);
let person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

console.log(person1); // Output: Person { name: 'Alex', age: 19 }
console.log(person2); // Output: Person { name: 'Bob', age: 25 }
```
---

### Default constructors

In JavaScript, unlike some other languages like Java, there is no concept of default constructors provided by the compiler. In JavaScript, if you do not define a constructor for a class, it will automatically have an empty constructor provided by the language itself.

#### Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
class MyClass {
  // No constructor defined explicitly
}

// Creating an object of MyClass
let obj = new MyClass();
```

In this example, `MyClass` does not have an explicitly defined constructor. However, JavaScript automatically provides a default constructor, which essentially does nothing. When an object `obj` of `MyClass` is created, this default constructor is invoked, but since it does not contain any code, no initialization or setup is performed.

It's important to note that in JavaScript, if you explicitly define a constructor for a class, the default constructor will not be automatically provided. Therefore, if you still want to have an empty constructor, you'll need to define it explicitly:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // Empty constructor
  }
}
```
---

### Copy constructors

In JavaScript, unlike languages like C++ and Java, there is no built-in support for copy constructors. However, you can achieve similar functionality by defining custom methods or using object cloning techniques.

#### Example:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Custom method for copying a Person object
  copy() {
    return new Person(this.name, this.age);
  }
}

let person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
let person2 = person1.copy();

console.log(person1); // Output: Person { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
console.log(person2); // Output: Person { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
```

In this example, the `Person` class does not have a built-in copy constructor. Instead, a custom `copy()` method is defined to create a new `Person` object with the same properties as the original object. This achieves the functionality of copying an object.

JavaScript also provides object cloning techniques such as `Object.assign()` or the spread operator (`...`) to create shallow copies of objects. However, these techniques may not work as expected for objects with nested properties or prototype methods. For deep cloning, you may need to use libraries like Lodash or implement custom deep cloning logic.

### Conversion constructors

Conversion constructors provide a means for a compiler to implicitly create an object belonging to one class based on an object of a different type. These constructors are usually invoked implicitly to convert arguments or operands to an appropriate type, but they may also be called explicitly.

---

### Move constructors

In C++, move constructors take an Rvalue reference to an object of the class, and are used to implement ownership transfer of the parameter object's resources.

---

## What is Destructors

In object-oriented programming, a destructor is a method which is invoked mechanically just before the memory of the object is released. It can happen when its lifetime is bound to scope and the execution leaves the scope, when it is embedded in another object whose lifetime ends, or when it was allocated dynamically and is released explicitly. Its main purpose is to free the resources (memory allocations, open files or sockets, database connections, resource locks, etc.) which were acquired by the object during its life and/or deregister from other entities which may keep references to it. Use of destructors is needed for the process of Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).

With most kinds of automatic garbage collection algorithms, the releasing of memory may happen a long time after the object becomes unreachable, making destructors (called finalizers in this case) unsuitable for most purposes. In such languages, the freeing of resources is done either through a lexical construct (such as try..finally, Python's "with" or Java's "try-with-resources"), which is the equivalent to RAII, or explicitly by calling a function (equivalent to explicit deletion); in particular, many object-oriented languages use the Dispose pattern.

Several rules govern the declaration of destructors. Destructors:

Don't accept arguments.
Don't return a value (or void).
Can't be declared as const, volatile, or static. However, they can be invoked for the destruction of objects declared as const, volatile, or static.
Can be declared as virtual. Using virtual destructors, you can destroy objects without knowing their typeâ€”the correct destructor for the object is invoked using the virtual function mechanism. Destructors can also be declared as pure virtual functions for abstract classes.

### Summary:

> Destructors are functions that are called before the object is destroyed. They primarily serve the purpose of releasing resources acquired by the object during its lifetime, such as memory allocations, file handles, or database connections.

### Using destructors

Destructors are called when one of the following events occurs:

- A local (automatic) object with block scope goes out of scope.
- Use delete to deallocate an object allocated using new. Using delete[] results in undefined behavior.
- Use delete[] to deallocate an object allocated using new[]. Using delete results in undefined behavior.
- The lifetime of a temporary object ends.
- A program ends and global or static objects exist.
- The destructor is explicitly called using the destructor function's fully qualified name.

Destructors can freely call class member functions and access class member data. However, there are two restrictions on their use: you can't take its address, and derived classes don't inherit the destructor of their base class.

### Properties of Destructor

The following are the main properties of Destructors:

- The destructor function is automatically invoked when the objects are destroyed.
- It cannot be declared static or const.
- The destructor does not have arguments.
- It has no return type, not even void.
- An object of a class with a destructor cannot become a member of the union.
- A destructor should be declared in the public section of the class.
- The programmer cannot access the address of the destructor.

### When is the destructor called?

A destructor function is called automatically when the object goes out of scope:

- The function ends.
- The program ends.
- A block containing local variables ends.
- A delete operator is called.

### [Example: (C++)](https://github.com/m-mdy-m/algorithms-data-structures/blob/main/2.OOP/concepts/MediumExample/Destructor.c%2B%2B)

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Resource {
public:
    Resource() {
        std::cout << "Resource acquired\n";
    }

    ~Resource() {
        std::cout << "Resource released\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Resource myResource;
    // Object goes out of scope at the end of main function
    return 0;
}
```
