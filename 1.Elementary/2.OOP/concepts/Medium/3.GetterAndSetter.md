In object-oriented programming, getters and setters are methods used to control access to the properties of an object. They allow you to retrieve (get) and assign (set) the values of object properties, respectively. This helps enforce encapsulation and maintain data integrity by controlling how properties are accessed and modified.

### Getter:

A getter is a special type of method in object-oriented programming languages that allows you to access the value of a property from an object. Getters provide a way to retrieve the value of a property without directly accessing the underlying data. They offer a controlled interface for reading property values, often allowing for additional logic, such as computation or validation, to be performed before returning the value.

Key points about getters:

1. **Accessing Property Values**: Getters are used to access the value of a property in an object. Instead of directly accessing the property, you invoke the getter method, which returns the property value.

2. **Read-only Access**: Getters typically provide read-only access to the property, meaning you can't modify the property's value directly through the getter. This helps maintain data integrity and encapsulation by controlling how the property is accessed.

3. **Additional Logic**: Getters can include additional logic, such as computation or validation, before returning the property value. This allows for custom behavior when retrieving the property value.

4. **Syntax**: In many programming languages like JavaScript, getters are defined using a special syntax, often using the `get` keyword followed by the name of the property being accessed.



#### Example in JavaScript:
```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this._radius = radius;
  }

  // Getter method
  get radius() {
    // Additional logic can be performed here
    return this._radius;
  }
}

const myCircle = new Circle(5);
console.log(myCircle.radius); // Output: 5
```

In this example, `radius` is a getter method that allows you to access the `_radius` property of a `Circle` object. When you invoke `myCircle.radius`, it internally calls the getter method, which returns the value of `_radius`.

### Setter:

A setter is a special type of method in object-oriented programming languages that allows you to assign a new value to a property of an object. Setters provide a controlled way to modify the value of a property, often incorporating validation or additional logic to ensure data integrity and enforce business rules.

Key points about setters:

1. **Modifying Property Values**: Setters are used to modify the value of a property in an object. Instead of directly assigning a value to the property, you invoke the setter method and pass the new value as an argument.

2. **Write-only Access**: Setters typically provide write-only access to the property, meaning you can't retrieve the property's current value directly through the setter. This helps enforce encapsulation by controlling how the property is modified.

3. **Validation and Logic**: Setters often include validation logic to ensure that the new value meets certain criteria or business rules. This can involve checking data types, ranges, or other conditions before allowing the assignment.

4. **Triggering Actions**: Setters can also be used to trigger actions or side effects when a property is being modified. For example, you might update related properties or notify other parts of the system about the change.

5. **Syntax**: In many programming languages like JavaScript, setters are defined using a special syntax, often using the `set` keyword followed by the name of the property being set.


#### Example in JavaScript:
```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this._radius = radius;
  }

  // Setter method
  set radius(newRadius) {
    // Validation logic
    if (newRadius > 0) {
      this._radius = newRadius;
    } else {
      console.error("Radius must be a positive number.");
    }
  }
}

const myCircle = new Circle(5);

// Modifying radius using the setter
myCircle.radius = 10;
console.log(myCircle.radius); // Output: 10

// Trying to set negative radius (validation)
myCircle.radius = -5; // Output: "Radius must be a positive number."
console.log(myCircle.radius); // Output: 10 (radius remains unchanged)
```

In this example, `radius` is a setter method that allows you to modify the `_radius` property of a `Circle` object. When you invoke `myCircle.radius = 10`, it internally calls the setter method, which validates the new value before assigning it to `_radius`.
