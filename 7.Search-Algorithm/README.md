### What is Searching?

Searching is the fundamental process of locating a specific element or item within a collection of data. This collection of data can take various forms, such as arrays, lists, trees, or other structured representations. The primary objective of searching is to determine whether the desired element exists within the data, and if so, to identify its precise location or retrieve it. It plays an important role in various computational tasks and real-world applications, including information retrieval, data analysis, decision-making processes, and more.

### Introduction Searching Algorithms

All search algorithms make use of a search key in order to proceed with the procedure. Search algorithms are expected to return a success or a failure status, usually denoted by Boolean true/false. Different search algorithms are available, and the performance and efficiency of the same depend on the data and on the manner in which they are used.

A linear search algorithm is considered the most basic of all search algorithms. The best perhaps is binary search. There are other search algorithms such as the depth-first search algorithm, breadth-first algorithm, etc. The efficiency of a search algorithm is measured by the number of times a comparison of the search key is done in the worst case. The notation used in search algorithms is O(n), where n is the number of comparisons done. It gives the idea of the asymptotic upper bound of execution time required for the algorithm with respect to a given condition.

Search cases in search algorithms can be categorized as best case, average case and worst case. In some algorithms, all the three cases might be asymptotically the same, whereas in some others there could be a large difference. The average behavior of the search algorithm helps in determining the usefulness of the algorithm.

> Summary : A search algorithm is the step-by-step procedure used to locate specific data among a collection of data. It is considered a fundamental procedure in computing. In computer science, when searching for data, the difference between a fast application and a slower one often lies in the use of the proper search algorithm.

### Simple explanation:


### Searching terminologies:
- **Target Element:**
    In searching, there is always a specific target element or item that you want to find within the data collection. This target could be a value, a record, a key, or any other data entity of interest.
- **Search Space:**
    The search space refers to the entire collection of data within which you are looking for the target element. Depending on the data structure used, the search space may vary in size and organization.
- **Complexity:**
    Searching can have different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and the algorithm used. The complexity is often measured in terms of time and space requirements.
- **Deterministic vs. Non-deterministic:**
Some searching algorithms, like binary search, are deterministic, meaning they follow a clear, systematic approach. Others, such as linear search, are non-deterministic, as they may need to examine the entire search space in the worst case.

### Applications of Searching:
Applications of search algorithms
Specific applications of search algorithms include:

- Problems in combinatorial optimization, such as:
    - The vehicle routing problem, a form of shortest path problem
    - The knapsack problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
    - The nurse scheduling problem
- Problems in constraint satisfaction, such as:
    - The map coloring problem
    - Filling in a sudoku or crossword puzzle
- In game theory and especially combinatorial game theory, choosing the best move to make next (such as with the minmax algorithm)
- Finding a combination or password from the whole set of possibilities
- Factoring an integer (an important problem in cryptography)
- Optimizing an industrial process, such as a chemical reaction, by changing the parameters of the process (like - temperature, pressure, and pH)
- Retrieving a record from a database
- Finding the maximum or minimum value in a list or array
- Checking to see if a given value is present in a set of values
