# Key Concepts in OOP:

### Beginner:

1. **[Class](concepts/Beginner/1-class.md):**

- exercises : 
    1. Define a class called `Rectangle` with a constructor that takes two parameters `width` and `height`. This class should also have a method called `calculateArea()` which returns the area of the rectangle (width * height).
    2. Create a class called `Person` with a constructor that takes two parameters `name` and `age`. Inside the constructor, assign these parameters to attributes `name` and `age` respectively. This class should also have a method called `sayHello()` which prints a greeting message including the person's name.
    3.  Discuss with examples how using classes can help organize code better and promote reusability.
    4.  Explain with examples some limitations or drawbacks class .
    5. Write a class called `Calculator` with methods `add()` and `subtract()`.

2. **[Object](concepts/Beginner/2-Object.md):**

3. **[Encapsulation](concepts/Beginner/3.Encapsulation.md)**

- exercises : 
    1. **Exercise: Bank Account Management System**
       - Design a `BankAccount` class with private properties including `accountNumber`, `balance`, and `owner`.
       - Implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance, ensuring accurate balance updates and controlled access to account details.
       - Challenge: Develop robust access control mechanisms to safeguard sensitive account information, such as account numbers and owner details.
    
    2. **Exercise: Library Catalog System**
       - Create a `Book` class to encapsulate book details like title, author, and ISBN.
       - Develop a `Library` class to manage a collection of books, providing functionalities for adding, removing, and searching for books.
       - Ensure that book details are encapsulated within the `Book` class and access to the library catalog is appropriately restricted.
       - Challenge: Implement a checkout system to monitor book availability and borrower details, ensuring proper encapsulation of borrower information.
    
    3. **Exercise: Employee Management System**
       - Define an `Employee` class with private attributes such as `name`, `employeeId`, and `salary`.
       - Create methods to update employee details, such as name and salary, while enforcing data validation rules.
       - Ensure that employee data is encapsulated within the `Employee` class and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
       - Challenge: Establish access control mechanisms to manage employee roles and permissions, allowing only authorized users to modify employee information.
    
    4. **Exercise: Online Shopping Cart**
       - Develop a `Product` class to encapsulate product details like name, price, and quantity.
       - Implement a `ShoppingCart` class to manage shopping cart items, providing functionalities for adding, removing, and updating items.
       - Ensure that product information is encapsulated within the `Product` class and access to shopping cart data is carefully controlled.
       - Challenge: Implement inventory management to monitor product availability and handle out-of-stock scenarios while maintaining encapsulation of product data.
    
    5. **Exercise: School Management System**
       - Create a `Student` class with private properties including `name`, `studentId`, and `grade`.
       - Implement methods to enroll students in courses, update their grades, and generate academic reports.
       - Ensure that student data is encapsulated within the `Student` class and access is restricted to authorized personnel.
       - Challenge: Implement grade validation rules and academic performance tracking to ensure data integrity and maintain encapsulation of student records.

### Medium:

### Medium Section Reminder:

Before exploring the Medium section, make sure you've completed the foundational concepts outlined in the [`Simple`](../README.md) section. These fundamentals provide a solid grounding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), ensuring you're well-prepared to delve into more advanced topics.

Once you're confident with the Simple section, you'll be ready to explore the Medium section, where you'll encounter deeper insights into OOP principles and practices. From constructors and access modifiers to design patterns and performance analysis, the Medium section offers a rich learning experience to further enhance your OOP skills.

So, take your time mastering the Simple concepts, and when you're ready, let the Medium section broaden your understanding and proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming!
