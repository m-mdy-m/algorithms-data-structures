# Introduction of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in computer science that facilitates the organization and modeling of real-world entities into software systems. At its core, OOP revolves around the concepts of classes and objects.

## Classes and Objects:

In OOP, a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. These objects, also referred to as instances, encapsulate both data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions) related to a specific entity.

#### Example:

To illustrate, let's envision a forest ecosystem modeled using OOP principles, with animals as the focal point. We can establish a class titled `Animal`, outlining attributes like `name` and methods such as `eat`, `sleep`, `wakeUp`, and `run`.

For instance, an "Elephant" can be instantiated as an object of the `Animal` class. It possesses a distinct `name` ("elephant") and is capable of executing actions like eating, sleeping, waking up, and running.

However, an elephant also features unique characteristics such as `color`, `height`, `weight`, and `shape`, which are specific to elephants and distinguish them from other forest inhabitants.

#### Clarification:

It's crucial to clarify that while the term "class" defines the blueprint for objects, the class itself is not an object but rather a template used for object creation. The objects, such as "Elephant," are instances of the class and embody the attributes and behaviors outlined within the class blueprint.

By employing classes and objects within OOP, we can adeptly model and structure complex systems, effectively representing real-world entities in a structured and manageable manner.
