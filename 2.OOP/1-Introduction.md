# Introduction of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in computer science that facilitates the organization and modeling of real-world entities into software systems. At its core, OOP revolves around the concepts of classes and objects.

## Classes and Objects:
In OOP, a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. These objects, also referred to as instances, encapsulate both data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions) related to a specific entity.

#### Example:

Let's consider a forest model where animals are represented using the OOP paradigm. We can create a class named `Animal`, which defines attributes such as `name` and methods such as `eat`, `sleep`, `wakeUp`, and `run`.

For instance, an "Elephant" can be considered an object of the `Animal` class. It possesses a unique `name` ("elephant") and can perform actions such as eating, sleeping, waking up, and running.

However, an elephant also has additional unique characteristics such as `color`, `height`, `weight`, and `shape`, which are specific to elephants and not present in other animals of the forest.

#### Clarification:

It's important to clarify that while we use the term "class" to define the blueprint for objects, the class itself is not an object but rather a template from which objects are created. The objects, such as "Elephant," are instances of the class and embody the characteristics and behaviors defined within the class blueprint.

By utilizing classes and objects in OOP, we can effectively model and organize complex systems by representing real-world entities in a structured and manageable way
