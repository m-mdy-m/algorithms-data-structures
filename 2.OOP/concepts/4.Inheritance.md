# Summary:

In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It is a fundamental concept in OOP that promotes code reuse and establishes relationships between classes.
Inheritance in oops is based on a hierarchical relationship between classes, where a derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) inherits the characteristics of a base class (also known as a superclass or parent class). The derived class extends the functionality of the base class by adding new features or overriding existing ones.
