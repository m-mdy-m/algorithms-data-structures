# Association, Aggregation, and Composition

In object-oriented programming, Association, Aggregation, and Composition are three types of relationships between classes.

## Association

**Definition:** Association represents a relationship between two or more classes where each class has its own lifecycle and there is no owner. It is a loosely coupled relationship.

**Example:** Consider the relationship between a `Teacher` and a `Student` class. A `Teacher` can have multiple students, and a `Student` can have multiple teachers.

**Example In Js:**

```javascript
// Association Example
class Teacher {
  teach(student) {
    console.log("Teaching...");
    student.learn();
  }
}

class Student {
  learn() {
    console.log("Learning...");
  }
}

const teacher = new Teacher();
const student = new Student();

teacher.teach(student);
```

**Pros:**

- Flexibility: Classes can interact with each other without being tightly bound.
- Reusability: Both classes can be reused independently in other relationships.

**Cons:**

- Lack of ownership: There's no clear ownership of one class over the other, which can lead to ambiguity in code maintenance.

## Aggregation

**Definition:** Aggregation is a specialized form of association where objects have a "has-a" relationship. It represents a whole-part or a part-of relationship.

**Example:** A `Department` class containing multiple `Employee` objects. Employees can exist independently of the department and can belong to different departments.

**Example In Js:**

```javascript
// Aggregation Example
class Department {
  constructor() {
    this.employees = [];
  }

  addEmployee(employee) {
    this.employees.push(employee);
  }
}

class Employee {
  work() {
    console.log("Working...");
  }
}

const department = new Department();
const employee1 = new Employee();
const employee2 = new Employee();

department.addEmployee(employee1);
department.addEmployee(employee2);
```

**Pros:**

- Code Reusability: Both classes can exist independently and be reused.
- Flexibility: Objects can be added or removed from the aggregation without affecting the overall structure.

**Cons:**

- Lifetime management: The lifetime of the contained object can be independent of the container, leading to potential issues if not managed properly.

## Composition

**Definition:** Composition is a strong form of aggregation with a "contains-a" relationship where the containing object manages the creation and lifetime of its parts.

**Example:** A `Car` class composed of `Engine`, `Wheels`, and `Chassis`. The parts cannot exist independently of the car.

**Example In Js:**

```javascript
// Composition Example
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.engine = new Engine();
    this.wheels = new Wheels();
    this.chassis = new Chassis();
  }
}

class Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine starting...");
  }
}

class Wheels {
  roll() {
    console.log("Wheels rolling...");
  }
}

class Chassis {
  stabilityCheck() {
    console.log("Chassis stability check...");
  }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.engine.start();
myCar.wheels.roll();
myCar.chassis.stabilityCheck();
```

**Pros:**

- Strong ownership: The containing object fully controls the existence and lifetime of its parts, leading to clearer code and design.
- Encapsulation: The containing object encapsulates its parts, making it easier to manage complex systems.

**Cons:**

- Tight coupling: Changes to the containing object may have significant impacts on its parts, potentially making the code less flexible.

## Comparison

| Feature     | Association    | Aggregation    | Composition    |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Ownership   | No ownership   | Part owner     | Full ownership |
| Flexibility | High           | High           | Low            |
| Coupling    | Loose coupling | Loose coupling | Tight coupling |
| Dependency  | Low            | Low            | High           |
| Reusability | High           | High           | Low            |

## Best Practices in JavaScript

- **Association:** Utilize event-driven programming or callback functions to establish loose associations between objects.
- **Aggregation:** Implement factory patterns or dependency injection to manage the creation and lifecycles of aggregated objects.
- **Composition:** Utilize composition over inheritance to build complex objects with clear ownership and encapsulation.
