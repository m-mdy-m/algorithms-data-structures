# Access Modifiers

Access modifiers play a crucial role in object-oriented programming languages like C++, Java, and C#. They determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members within a program, thus contributing significantly to the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, and information hiding. Let's delve into a comprehensive examination of access modifiers across these languages.

### Core Concepts:

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (member variables) and the operations that manipulate that data (member functions) within a single unit (class). Access modifiers control how external code interacts with this data.
- **Abstraction:** Exposing essential functionalities while hiding the underlying implementation details. Access modifiers help achieve this by making certain elements internal to a class or its inheritance hierarchy.
- **Information Hiding:** Protecting sensitive or critical data from unintended modification by restricting access. Access modifiers play a key role in preventing unauthorized access.

> **Summary:** Access Modifiers or Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign the accessibility to the class members, i.e., they set some restrictions on the class members so that they canâ€™t be directly accessed by the outside functions.

## C++

- **Public:** When members of a class are declared under the public specifier, they become accessible from outside the class as well as from within. This means that any function or object outside the class can access public members directly. Public members essentially define the interface of the class, as they represent the functionalities that the class provides to its users.

    - **Use Case:** Public members form the public interface of the class, defining how users interact with it.

- **Private:** The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class. Direct access to them by any object or function outside the class is prohibited. Only internal functions are allowed to access the private data members of the class.

    - **Purpose:** Encapsulation, protecting sensitive data and implementation details.

- **Protected** Protected access advisor is similar to private access in that it cannot be accessed outside of your class except with the help of a classmate. With the difference that class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass of that class.

    - **Purpose:** Facilitating inheritance, allowing derived classes to access and potentially modify certain aspects of the base class behavior.

> **NOTE:** By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier
