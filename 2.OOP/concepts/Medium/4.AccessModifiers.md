# Access Modifiers

Access modifiers play a crucial role in object-oriented programming languages like C++, Java, and C#. They determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members within a program, thus contributing significantly to the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, and information hiding. Let's delve into a comprehensive examination of access modifiers across these languages.

### Core Concepts:

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (member variables) and the operations that manipulate that data (member functions) within a single unit (class). Access modifiers control how external code interacts with this data.
- **Abstraction:** Exposing essential functionalities while hiding the underlying implementation details. Access modifiers help achieve this by making certain elements internal to a class or its inheritance hierarchy.
- **Information Hiding:** Protecting sensitive or critical data from unintended modification by restricting access. Access modifiers play a key role in preventing unauthorized access.

> **Summary:** Access Modifiers or Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign the accessibility to the class members, i.e., they set some restrictions on the class members so that they canâ€™t be directly accessed by the outside functions.

# types in languages

## C++

- **Public:** All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone Data, functions and variables can be accessed publicly by other classes and functions.

- **Private:** The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class. Direct access to them by any object or function outside the class is prohibited. Only internal functions are allowed to access the private data members of the class.

- **Protected** Protected access advisor is similar to private access in that it cannot be accessed outside of your class except with the help of a classmate. With the difference that class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass of that class.

> **NOTE-1:** If we do not specify any access modifiers for the members inside the class, then by default the access modifier for the members will be Private.
