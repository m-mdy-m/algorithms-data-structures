## What is dependency injection

In object-oriented programming (OOP) software design, dependency injection is the process of supplying a resource that a given piece of code requires. The required resource, which is often a component of the application itself, is called a dependency.

When a software component depends upon other resources to complete its intended purpose, it needs to know which resources it should communicate with, where to locate them and how to communicate with them.

One way of structuring the code is to map the location of each required resource. Another way is to use dependency injections and have an external piece of code assume the responsibility of locating the resources. Typically, the external piece of code is implemented by using a Frameworks

Dependency injections are useful to create loosely coupled programs, while also following the SOLID software design principles. This helps improve the reusability of code, while also reducing the frequency of needing to change a class, a template of the methods or variables in an object.
