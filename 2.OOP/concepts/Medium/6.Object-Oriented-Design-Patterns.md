## What is Design Patterns :

In software engineering, a design pattern describes a relatively small, well-defined aspect (i.e. functionality) of a computer program in terms of how to write the code.
Using a pattern is intended to leverage an existing concept rather than re-inventing it. This can decrease the time to develop software and increase the quality of the resulting program.
Some consider using patterns to be best practice for software design. Some consider using design patterns as a structured approach to computer programming.

Conceptually, design pattern may be described as more specific than programming paradigm and less specific than algorithm.

## Parts :

1. Name
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Consequences and trade-os of application

## The goals of a design pattern:

- Codify good design
- Distill and disseminate experience
- Aid to novices and experts alike
- Abstract how to think about design
- Give design structures explicit names
- Common vocabulary
- Reduced complexity
- Greater expressiveness
- Capture and preserve design information
- Articulate design decisions succinctly
- Improve documentation
- Facilitate restructuring/refactoring
- Patterns are interrelated
- Additional
- flexibility
