## What is Design Patterns :

In software engineering, a design pattern describes a relatively small, well-defined aspect (i.e. functionality) of a computer program in terms of how to write the code.
Using a pattern is intended to leverage an existing concept rather than re-inventing it. This can decrease the time to develop software and increase the quality of the resulting program.
Some consider using patterns to be best practice for software design. Some consider using design patterns as a structured approach to computer programming.

Conceptually, design pattern may be described as more specific than programming paradigm and less specific than algorithm.

# Patterns by type

## Creational

### Introduction :

Creational design patterns are design patterns which focus on creating objects effectively. They bring flexibility to the software design and help in the reusability of existing code.Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. are composed of two dominant ideas.

1. **Encapsulating Knowledge About Concrete Classes:**

   - Imagine you're building a game with various characters, like dogs and cats. Traditionally, you might have code scattered throughout your application that directly creates `Dog` or `Cat` objects. This approach makes your code tightly coupled to these specific classes.
   - Creational patterns advocate for encapsulating this knowledge of which concrete classes are used within a central location. This can be achieved through techniques like **factory methods** or **abstract factories**. These factories become responsible for creating the specific objects based on your request, shielding the rest of your code from the underlying implementation details.

2. **Hiding How Objects Are Created and Combined:**

   - Often, the process of creating objects can be complex, involving multiple steps or decisions based on certain conditions. Exposing these intricacies in your code can make it hard to reason about and modify.
   - Creational patterns address this by hiding the object creation logic behind a well-defined interface. This allows you to use the objects without worrying about the specifics of their instantiation. For instance, the **builder pattern** lets you construct complex objects step-by-step using a fluent interface, separating the object creation process from its usage.

**Summary**
> Creational patterns are ones that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case. There are mainly 6 types of creational design patterns: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Prototype, Builder and Object Pool pattern.

## Types Creational:

### Abstract factory
  creates an instance of several derived classes belonging to a single family of objects. However, employment of this pattern, as with similar design patterns, may result in unnecessary complexity and extra work in the initial writing of code.

- Summary : a class requests the objects it requires from a factory object instead of creating the objects directly

- > Example:
Suppose we go to an ice cream factory and order a chocolate ice cream. When we place an order, the shopkeeper sends the order to the kitchen and we get it in a few minutes when the ice cream is ready. We are not concerned with what happens inside the kitchen and what ingredients are used to make the ice cream. The internal call by the shopkeeper to create a vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry ice cream is hidden from the user.


**It may be used to solve problems such as:**

- How can an application be independent of how its objects are created?
- How can a class be independent of how the objects that it requires are created?
- How can families of related or dependent objects be created?

The pattern describes how to solve such problems:

- Encapsulate object creation in a separate (factory) object by defining and implementing an interface for creating objects.
- Delegate object creation to a factory object instead of creating objects directly.
This makes a class independent of how its objects are created. A class may be configured with a factory object, which it uses to create objects, and the factory object can be exchanged at runtime.


#### Key components of Abstract factory Pattern

> [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-factory-pattern-javascript-design-patterns/)

- Abstract Factory: This is an interface or an abstract class that declares a set of factory methods for creating a family of related objects.

- Concrete Factory: These are the implementations of the abstract factory interface. Each concrete factory is responsible for creating a specific family of related objects.

- Abstract Products: These are interfaces or abstract classes that declare the common set of methods for the objects within a family.

- Concrete Products: These are the actual implementations of the abstract products. Each concrete product is specific to a particular family and is created by a corresponding concrete factory.

- Client: The client code interacts with the abstract factory and abstract product interfaces.

### Builder: 

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to construct a complex object step by step. It allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step fashion, where the construction process can vary based on the type of product being built. The pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Simple and understandable explanation:**

Imagine constructing a complex object, like a car. Traditionally, you might define a constructor with numerous parameters for engine type, transmission, features, etc. This approach becomes cumbersome with many optional parameters and can lead to cluttered code.

The Builder Pattern introduces a dedicated "Builder" class. This class offers methods for setting each of the object's attributes independently. Users can then configure the object by chaining these methods on the builder, specifying the desired values. Finally, a "build" method on the builder assembles the final object based on the provided configuration.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved Readability:** Separating construction logic from the object itself enhances code clarity, especially for objects with many optional attributes.
- **Flexibility:** The Builder allows for creating different object variations using the same construction process. You can define multiple builders for the same object type, each specializing in a specific configuration.
- **Optional Parameters:** The Builder gracefully handles optional parameters by providing methods that can be left unused if certain features are not needed. This avoids cumbersome constructors with numerous default values.

> Summary : The Builder Design Pattern offers a structured approach to constructing complex objects, promoting better code organization, improved readability, and increased flexibility in creating object variations.


**The Builder design pattern solves problems like**

- How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
- How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?

The Builder design pattern describes how to solve such problems:

- Encapsulate creating and assembling the parts of a complex object in a separate Builder object.
- A class delegates object creation to a Builder object instead of creating the objects directly.
A class (the same construction process) can delegate to different Builder objects to create different representations of a complex object.

####  Example Problem
[source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)

Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.

For example, let’s think about how to create a House object. To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger, brighter house, with a backyard and other goodies (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?

The simplest solution is to extend the base House class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more.

There’s another approach that doesn’t involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base House class with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem.

![](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/problem2.png?id=2e91039b6c7d2d2df6ee519983a3b036)

In most cases most of the parameters will be unused, making the constructor calls pretty ugly. For instance, only a fraction of houses have swimming pools, so the parameters related to swimming pools will be useless nine times out of ten.

#### Solution 

The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders.

![](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/solution1.png?id=8ce82137f8935998de802cae59e00e11)

The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (buildWalls, buildDoor, etc.). To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object. The important part is that you don’t need to call all of the steps. You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.

Some of the construction steps might require different implementation when you need to build various representations of the product. For example, walls of a cabin may be built of wood, but the castle walls must be built with stone.

### Structural
Structural patterns concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- Adapter allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
- Bridge decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- Composite composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
- Decorator dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object.
- Facade provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
- Flyweight reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- Proxy provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

### Behavioral
Most behavioral design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- Chain of responsibility delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
- Command creates objects that encapsulate actions and parameters.
- Interpreter implements a specialized language.
- Iterator accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- Mediator allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
- Memento provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
- Observer is a publish/subscribe pattern, which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
- State allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Strategy allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
- Template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
- Visitor separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

### Concurrency 
- Active Object : Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.

- Balking: Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.

- Binding properties: Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.

- Compute kernel:The same calculation many times in parallel, differing by integer parameters used with non-branching pointer math into shared arrays, such as GPU-optimized Matrix multiplication or Convolutional neural network.

- Double-checked locking : Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual locking logic proceed.
Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern.
- Event-based asynchronous	Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.
- Guarded suspension: Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.	No	—
- Join	Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model.	No	—
- Lock	One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.[22]	No	PoEAA[14]
- Messaging design pattern (MDP)	Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.	No	—
- Monitor object	An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.	Yes	—
- Reactor	A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.	Yes	—
- Read-write lock	Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations. An underlying semaphore might be used for writing, and a Copy-on-write mechanism may or may not be used.	No	—
- Scheduler	Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.	No	—
- Service handler pattern	For each request, a server spawns a dedicated client handler to handle a request.[23] Also referred to as thread-per-session.[24]	No	—
- Thread pool	A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern.	No	—
- Thread-specific storage	Static or "global" memory local to a thread.	Yes	—
- Safe Concurrency with Exclusive Ownership	Avoiding the need for runtime concurrent mechanisms, because exclusive ownership can be proven. This is a notable capability of the Rust language, but compile-time checking isn't the only means, a programmer will often manually design such patterns into code - omitting the use of locking mechanism because the programmer assesses that a given variable is never going to be concurrently accessed.

- CPU atomic operation	x86 and other CPU architectures support a range of atomic instructions that guarantee memory safety for modifying and accessing primitive values (integers). For example, two threads may both increment a counter safely. These capabilities can also be used to implement the mechanisms for other concurrency patterns as above. The C# language uses the Interlocked class for these capabilities.
