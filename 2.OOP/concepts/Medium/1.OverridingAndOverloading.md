# Overriding and Overloading

> tip : In JavaScript, unlike in languages such as Java or C++, there isn't strict support for method overriding and method overloading as defined in classical object-oriented programming languages

## Introduction

**Overloading** : Overloading is a process that allows multiple functions or methods of the same name, but with different parameters, to be defined for a single class. Overriding is a process that allows child classes to modify the behavior of parent classes by redefining the methods defined in the parent class.

**Overriding**: Overriding is primarily used when having multiple implementations of a single interface or contract in subclasses. This allows you to use polymorphism instead of if/else statements when you need access to different versions of an object depending on its type.

**Summary**:To sum up, overloading and overriding are two distinct techniques that allow you to manipulate class behavior. By understanding these two of overloading and overriding techniques, you will improve your ability to create efficient programs by using fewer lines of code as well as being able to easily switch.

## Purpose of Overloading and Overriding

Understanding the purpose of overloading and overriding is essential for mastering object oriented programming. In this blog post, we’ll discuss about Overloading and Overriding and how they work together to create highly versatile and complex systems.

Polymorphism is a key concept in object oriented programming. It basically allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This is called “overloading” and it helps to reduce the amount of code developers need to write by allowing them to use the same function signature but with different parameters.

Another concept related to polymorphism is “method overriding”, which allows a subclass to override or replace an inherited characteristic of its parent class. This can be done by providing a subclass implementation that changes the behavior of a particular method without having to rewrite all of the functionality provided by its parent class.

Method overloading happens when multiple functions have the same name, but with different parameters or variations, which allows you to write multiple functions that do slightly different tasks. This can be useful when writing more complex systems because you don’t have to write a whole new function for every variation of your original task.

When it comes to method overriding, this occurs when a subclass overrides or replaces an inherited characteristic from its parent class. For example, if you have a subclass that inherits certain characteristics from its parent class, such as color or size, you can provide a subclass implementation in order to change the color or size without having to rewrite all of the other characteristics provided by its parent class.

Overall, both overloading and overriding are powerful concepts in object oriented programming that allow developers to quickly implement more complex systems without having to rewrite code.

## When to use overloading and overriding?

The concept of overloading and overriding may be a bit confusing at first, but with an understanding of Object Oriented (OO) programming using Java, it’s easy to differentiate the two. Overloading and overriding are both related to the concept of polymorphism, which involves having multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.
To start off, let’s define what overloading and overriding are. Overloading is when you create two or more methods in a single class with the same name but different parameter lists. Overriding,on the other hand, occurs when you subclass a method from a parent class in which you provide a unique implementation for that subclass. When you override a method, it will take precedence over the parent method.

Now that we know what overloading and overriding are let’s look at some examples. Let’s use an example of an Animal class as our base class for both concepts:

For overloading :

public void eat(String food); //method 1

public void eat(int food); //method 2

For overriding :

public void move(); //parent method

public void move(); //overriding child method

In this example, we have overloaded the eat() method by creating two parameters with different types (String and int). We have also overridden the move() method by providing a unique implementation in our child class. The child class will now call its own version of move() rather than calling it from the parent class.
