# Overriding and Overloading

> tip : In JavaScript, unlike in languages such as Java or C++, there isn't strict support for method overriding and method overloading as defined in classical object-oriented programming languages

## what is Overriding
Overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to provide its own behavior for the method, which may differ from the behavior defined in the superclass. Overriding is commonly used to customize the behavior of inherited methods to suit the needs of the subclass.


### Example

```java
class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal();
        animal.makeSound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

## what is Overloading
Overloading is a concept in programming where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters. This allows methods with the same name to perform different actions based on the arguments provided. Overloading is particularly useful when you want to provide multiple ways to call a method with varying parameters.

### Example

```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        int sumInt = calc.add(5, 3); // Output: 8
        double sumDouble = calc.add(2.5, 3.5); // Output: 6.0
    }
}
```

## Overriding vs Overloading

### Overriding:

- Occurs in inheritance, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
- The method signature remains the same in both the superclass and the subclass.
- Used to provide a specialized behavior for a method inherited from the superclass.
- Aims to customize the behavior of inherited methods in the subclass.

### Overloading:

- Occurs within a single class, where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
- The method signature differs based on the parameters accepted by each overloaded method.
- Used to provide multiple ways to call a method with varying parameters.
- Aims to provide flexibility and convenience in method invocation within the same class.

## Conclusion

Overriding and overloading are two important concepts in object-oriented programming that allow developers to customize method behavior and provide flexibility in method invocation. Overriding is used in inheritance to provide a specialized implementation of a method in a subclass, while overloading is used within a single class to provide multiple versions of a method with different parameters. Understanding the differences between overriding and overloading is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and flexible code in Java and other object-oriented programming languages.
