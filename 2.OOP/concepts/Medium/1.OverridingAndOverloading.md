# Overriding and Overloading

> tip : In JavaScript, unlike in languages such as Java or C++, there isn't strict support for method overriding and method overloading as defined in classical object-oriented programming languages

## Introduction

**Overloading** : Overloading is a process that allows multiple functions or methods of the same name, but with different parameters, to be defined for a single class. Overriding is a process that allows child classes to modify the behavior of parent classes by redefining the methods defined in the parent class.

**Overriding**: Overriding is primarily used when having multiple implementations of a single interface or contract in subclasses. This allows you to use polymorphism instead of if/else statements when you need access to different versions of an object depending on its type.

**Summary**:To sum up, overloading and overriding are two distinct techniques that allow you to manipulate class behavior. By understanding these two of overloading and overriding techniques, you will improve your ability to create efficient programs by using fewer lines of code as well as being able to easily switch.

## what is Overriding

Overloading in programming allows multiple functions or methods within the same class to share the same name but differ in their parameter lists. This enables developers to create methods with similar functionalities catering to different data types or numbers of parameters. It enhances code readability and reduces redundancy by consolidating related functionalities under a single method name.

## what is Overloading

Overriding is a concept used in inheritance, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows child classes to modify or extend the behavior of methods defined in the parent class. Overriding is primarily used to achieve polymorphism, where objects of different types can be treated uniformly through a common interface, promoting code reuse and extensibility.

## Purpose of Overloading and Overriding

Understanding the purpose of overloading and overriding is essential for mastering object-oriented programming. In this blog post, we'll explore these concepts and how they contribute to creating versatile and complex systems.

### Overloading

Overloading is a form of polymorphism where multiple functions can have the same name but differ in their parameters. Its primary purpose is to reduce code redundancy by allowing developers to use the same function signature for similar tasks with different parameter sets. By providing variations of a function, developers can handle different scenarios without needing to create entirely new functions.

### Overriding

Overriding, on the other hand, is a mechanism that allows a subclass to provide its own implementation for a method inherited from its superclass. It enables customization of behavior without altering the superclass's functionality. This concept is crucial for achieving polymorphism and code reuse. Subclasses can selectively modify or extend the behavior of inherited methods to suit their specific requirements, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

### Relationship between Overloading and Overriding

While overloading and overriding serve different purposes, they complement each other in creating robust object-oriented systems. Overloading allows for the creation of multiple methods with similar names but different parameters, facilitating code reuse and readability. Overriding, on the other hand, enables subclasses to tailor inherited methods to their needs, promoting flexibility and polymorphism. Together, these concepts empower developers to efficiently design and implement complex software systems while adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming.

In summary, overloading and overriding are fundamental techniques that enable developers to create modular, flexible, and maintainable codebases, ultimately contributing to the development of high-quality software solutions.

## When to Use Overloading and Overriding?

Understanding when to use overloading and overriding is essential for designing flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems. Both concepts are related to polymorphism, where methods with the same name can behave differently based on their signatures or implementations.

### Overloading

**When to Use Overloading:**

- Use overloading when you want to provide multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameter lists.
- Overloading is suitable for situations where you want to offer different ways of invoking a method based on varying parameter types or numbers.
- It enhances code readability and reduces redundancy by consolidating related functionalities under a single method name.

**Example:**

```java
public void eat(String food); // Method 1
public void eat(int food);    // Method 2
```

In this example, we have overloaded the `eat()` method to accept different types of food parameters (String and int).

### Overriding

**When to Use Overriding:**

- Use overriding when you want to provide a specialized implementation of a method defined in a superclass within a subclass.
- Overriding is essential for customizing behavior inherited from a superclass to suit the specific requirements of subclasses.
- It facilitates polymorphism by allowing objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface.

**Example:**

```java
public void move(); // Parent method
public void move(); // Overriding child method
```

In this example, we have overridden the `move()` method in the child class to provide a unique implementation tailored to the subclass's behavior.

## Overriding vs Overloading

| Aspect           | Overriding                                                                                          | Overloading                                                                                             |

| Definition       | Overriding is a concept where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method inherited from its superclass.                                          | Overloading is a mechanism allowing multiple methods within the same class to share the same name but have different parameter lists.                                   |
| Purpose          | Allows a subclass to change the behavior of a method inherited from its superclass without modifying the superclass itself.                                      | Enables developers to create multiple methods with similar functionalities catering to different data types or numbers of parameters within the same class. |
| Inheritance      | Occurs in inheritance relationships between classes, where a subclass inherits a method from its superclass and provides its own implementation.                | Occurs within a single class, where multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists are defined.                                                  |
| Method Signature | Must have the same method signature (name, return type, and parameters) as the method being overridden in the superclass.                                       | Must have the same method name but can differ in the number, type, or sequence of parameters.                                                                         |
| Use Case         | Typically used to customize behavior inherited from a superclass to suit the specific requirements of subclasses.                                                | Used to offer multiple methods with similar functionalities but differing parameter sets, enhancing code readability and reducing redundancy.                         |
| Syntax           | Uses `@Override` annotation to indicate that a method is being overridden from the superclass.                                                                     | No special syntax is required, methods with the same name but different parameter lists are declared within the same class.                                           |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both overriding and overloading are powerful techniques in Java that enable developers to achieve polymorphism and code reuse. However, they come with their own set of disadvantages that should be considered when designing object-oriented systems. It's important to use overriding and overloading judiciously and with caution to ensure maintainable and understandable codebases. Understanding the differences between these two concepts and their implications is crucial for writing efficient and robust Java programs.
