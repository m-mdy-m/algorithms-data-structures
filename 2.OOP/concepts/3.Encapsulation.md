# Summary:

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves restricting direct access to certain components of an object. By encapsulating data and methods within a class, encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is accessible only through a public interface, typically consisting of the object's methods.

## Why encapsulation is important

- **Data Protection:** Encapsulation allows for the hiding and protection of an object's internal state, preventing direct manipulation by external entities.
- **Controlled Access:** With encapsulation, access to an object's data is controlled through methods, enabling validation and manipulation of data before it is accessed or modified.
- **Enhanced Security:** By restricting access to sensitive data, encapsulation enhances security and reduces the risk of unintended data corruption or manipulation.
