# Summary:

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves restricting direct access to certain components of an object. By encapsulating data and methods within a class, encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is accessible only through a public interface, typically consisting of the object's methods.

## Why encapsulation is important

- **Data Protection:** Encapsulation allows for the hiding and protection of an object's internal state, preventing direct manipulation by external entities.
- **Controlled Access:** With encapsulation, access to an object's data is controlled through methods, enabling validation and manipulation of data before it is accessed or modified.
- **Enhanced Security:** By restricting access to sensitive data, encapsulation enhances security and reduces the risk of unintended data corruption or manipulation.

> Notably, languages like JavaScript, akin to C++, Java, and C#, do not inherently enforce encapsulation. Instead, developers often adopt conventions, such as prefixing private properties with an underscore (_), to signify intended privacy.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this._name = name; // Conventionally marked as private
    this._age = age;   // Conventionally marked as private
  }
  // Getter method for name
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  // Getter method for age
  get age() {
    return this._age;
  }

  // Method to update name
  updateName(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
    console.log(`Name updated to: ${newName}`);
  }

  // Method to update age
  updateAge(newAge) {
    this._age = newAge;
    console.log(`Age updated to: ${newAge}`);
  }
}
// Creating an instance of the User class
const myUser = new User("Ali", 19);

// Although JavaScript doesn't strictly enforce encapsulation, it's customary
// to adhere to conventions like prefixing private properties with an underscore (_).

// Accessing account details through getter methods
console.log("Name:", myUser.name); // Outputs: Ali
console.log("Age:", myUser.age); // Outputs: 19

// Updating name and age through methods
myUser.updateName("Mahdi"); // Outputs: Name updated to: Mahdi
myUser.updateAge(20); // Outputs: Age updated to: 20

// While JavaScript doesn't mandate encapsulation, it's recommended to utilize
// getter methods to access properties. Direct manipulation of underscore-prefixed
// properties should be avoided for better code maintainability and encapsulation.
console.log("Name:", myUser.name); // Outputs: Mahdi
console.log("Age:", myUser.age); // Outputs: 20
```
