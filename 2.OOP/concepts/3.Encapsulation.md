# Summary:

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves restricting direct access to certain components of an object. By encapsulating data and methods within a class, encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is accessible only through a public interface, typically consisting of the object's methods.

## Why encapsulation is important

- **Data Protection:** Encapsulation allows for the hiding and protection of an object's internal state, preventing direct manipulation by external entities.
- **Controlled Access:** With encapsulation, access to an object's data is controlled through methods, enabling validation and manipulation of data before it is accessed or modified.
- **Enhanced Security:** By restricting access to sensitive data, encapsulation enhances security and reduces the risk of unintended data corruption or manipulation.

> Notably, languages like JavaScript, akin to C++, Java, and C#, do not inherently enforce encapsulation. Instead, developers often adopt conventions, such as prefixing private properties with an underscore (_), to signify intended privacy.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this._name = name; // Conventionally marked as private
    this._age = age;   // Conventionally marked as private
  }
  // Getter method for name
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  // Getter method for age
  get age() {
    return this._age;
  }

  // Method to update name
  updateName(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
    console.log(`Name updated to: ${newName}`);
  }

  // Method to update age
  updateAge(newAge) {
    this._age = newAge;
    console.log(`Age updated to: ${newAge}`);
  }
}
// Creating an instance of the User class
const myUser = new User("Ali", 19);

// Although JavaScript doesn't strictly enforce encapsulation, it's customary
// to adhere to conventions like prefixing private properties with an underscore (_).

// Accessing account details through getter methods
console.log("Name:", myUser.name); // Outputs: Ali
console.log("Age:", myUser.age); // Outputs: 19

// Updating name and age through methods
myUser.updateName("Mahdi"); // Outputs: Name updated to: Mahdi
myUser.updateAge(20); // Outputs: Age updated to: 20

// While JavaScript doesn't mandate encapsulation, it's recommended to utilize
// getter methods to access properties. Direct manipulation of underscore-prefixed
// properties should be avoided for better code maintainability and encapsulation.
console.log("Name:", myUser.name); // Outputs: Mahdi
console.log("Age:", myUser.age); // Outputs: 20
```

### Languages that use encapsulation:

Encapsulation is a key concept in many object-oriented programming languages. Some of the languages that enforce encapsulation include:

- **Java:** Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in Java. It is achieved through the use of access modifiers such as `private`, `protected`, and `public`, which control the visibility of class members.
- **C++:** Encapsulation is supported in C++ through access specifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. These specifiers determine the accessibility of class members.
- **C#:** Similar to Java, C# provides access modifiers to enforce encapsulation, allowing developers to control the visibility of class members.

### Encapsulation Example in Java:

```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter method for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Getter method for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Method to update name
    public void updateName(String newName) {
        this.name = newName;
        System.out.println("Name updated to: " + newName);
    }

    // Method to update age
    public void updateAge(int newAge) {
        this.age = newAge;
        System.out.println("Age updated to: " + newAge);
    }

    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of the User class
        User myUser = new User("Ali", 19);

        // Accessing account details through getter methods
        System.out.println("Name: " + myUser.getName()); // Outputs: Ali
        System.out.println("Age: " + myUser.getAge()); // Outputs: 19

        // Updating name and age through methods
        myUser.updateName("Mahdi"); // Outputs: Name updated to: Mahdi
        myUser.updateAge(20); // Outputs: Age updated to: 20

        // Accessing updated details through getter methods
        System.out.println("Name: " + myUser.getName()); // Outputs: Mahdi
        System.out.println("Age: " + myUser.getAge()); // Outputs: 20
    }
}
```
