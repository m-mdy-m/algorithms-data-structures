# Summary:
Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages where poly means many and morphism means transforming one form into another. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. This is called polymorphism.
