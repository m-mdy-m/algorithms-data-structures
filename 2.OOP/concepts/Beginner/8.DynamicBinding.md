## Dynamic Binding

> Dynamic binding, also known as late binding or runtime binding, is a crucial concept in OOP that allows the determination of which method implementation to invoke at runtime, rather than during compilation.

Dynamic binding is also known as late binding or runtime binding. It means that the code that executes a method or an operator is determined at runtime, not at compile time. This allows the same method or operator to have different behaviors depending on the type or state of the objects that invoke or interact with it. For example, in OOP, you can define a generic method called print() that can print different types of objects, such as strings, numbers, or images, depending on their class or subclass. This is possible because the print() method is dynamically bound to the appropriate code for each object type at runtime.

OOP leverages dynamic binding by using inheritance and polymorphism. Through inheritance, new classes can be created based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and methods. Polymorphism allows objects to take on different forms, enabling the same method name to exhibit different behaviors based on the specific class instance. This dynamic binding occurs at runtime, providing flexibility and adaptability in code execution. By creating a hierarchy of classes and allowing methods to be overridden in subclasses, OOP supports the development of more generic, reusable, and versatile code, promoting the principles of abstraction and encapsulation.

### Why is dynamic binding useful?
Dynamic binding is useful because it allows for more flexibility, modularity, and abstraction in OOP. Flexibility means that you can change or extend the behavior of your code without modifying the existing code or breaking the compatibility. For example, you can add new subclasses or methods to your class hierarchy without affecting the existing ones, and the dynamic binding will automatically link them to the right code at runtime. Modularity means that you can divide your code into separate and independent units that can be reused and tested easily. For example, you can create a module that defines a generic interface for printing objects, and then create different modules that implement the interface for different types of objects, and the dynamic binding will automatically select the right module at runtime. Abstraction means that you can hide the details or complexity of your code and expose only the essential features or functionality. For example, you can create a class that represents a complex mathematical operation, and then overload the + operator to perform the operation on objects of that class, and the dynamic binding will automatically execute the right code at runtime.


### How to implement dynamic binding?

Dynamic binding can be implemented in different ways depending on the programming language and the design pattern. Some languages, such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, support dynamic binding by default, meaning that they do not check the types or signatures of the methods or operators at compile time, and they resolve them at runtime based on the objects involved. Other languages, such as Java, C#, and C++, support dynamic binding through the use of keywords or modifiers, such as abstract, virtual, override, or dynamic, that indicate that a method or an operator can be overridden or redefined in subclasses or derived classes. Some design patterns, such as the Strategy pattern, the Visitor pattern, or the Template method pattern, also support dynamic binding by defining a common interface or an abstract class that can be implemented or inherited by different classes or objects, and then passing or injecting them as parameters or dependencies to other classes or objects that can invoke their methods or operators at runtime.
