# Resource acquisition is initialization(RAII)

## Introduction:

Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom used in several object-oriented, statically typed programming languages to describe a particular language behavior. In RAII, holding a resource is a class invariant, and is tied to object lifetime. Resource allocation (or acquisition) is done during object creation (specifically initialization), by the constructor, while resource deallocation (release) is done during object destruction (specifically finalization), by the destructor. In other words, resource acquisition must succeed for initialization to succeed. Thus the resource is guaranteed to be held between when initialization finishes and finalization starts (holding the resources is a class invariant), and to be held only when the object is alive. Thus if there are no object leaks, there are no resource leaks


> Summary : RAII means that an object’s creation and destruction are tied to a resource being acquired and released.

**Benefits of RAII:**

* **Simplified Resource Management:** RAII eliminates the need for explicit resource management code in most cases. Once defined within the object's constructor and destructor, resource acquisition and release become automatic.
* **Encapsulation:** Resource handling logic is encapsulated within the object, promoting better code organization and reducing the risk of errors.
* **Exception Safety:** For stack-allocated resources (resources allocated within the same scope as their acquisition), RAII inherently provides exception safety. If an exception is thrown within an object's scope, the object's destructor will still be called, guaranteeing resource release.
* **Locality:** Acquisition and release logic are typically defined within the object's constructor and destructor, respectively, fostering better code readability and maintainability.

### Disadvantages

* **Limited Control:** RAII enforces automatic release upon object destruction, which can be less flexible if you need to hold onto a resource beyond the object's lifetime. In such cases, you might need to resort to manual resource management or techniques like smart pointers with custom deletion logic.
* **Non-Resource Management:** RAII is primarily designed for resources that have a clear concept of acquisition and release. It might not be the best fit for managing non-traditional resources like threads or complex data structures that require more intricate control over their lifetime.
* **Potential for Destructor Exceptions:** RAII destructors are guaranteed to be called. If a destructor throws an exception, it might disrupt the normal program termination sequence, leading to unexpected behavior. Careful design and exception handling within destructors are crucial.
* **Verbosity in Simple Cases:** For very simple resource management tasks, the boilerplate code associated with constructors and destructors can seem verbose, potentially outweighing the benefits.

## RAII can be summarized as follows:

- encapsulate each resource into a class, where
    - the constructor acquires the resource and establishes all class invariants or throws an exception if that cannot be done,
    - the destructor releases the resource and never throws exceptions;
- always use the resource via an instance of a RAII-class that either
    - has automatic storage duration or temporary lifetime itself, or
    - has lifetime that is bounded by the lifetime of an automatic or temporary object.
Move semantics make it possible to safely transfer resource ownership between objects, across scopes, and in and out of threads, while maintaining resource safety.
