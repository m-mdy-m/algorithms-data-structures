\part{Mathematical Logic and Foundations}
\label{part:foundations-logic}

\begin{partintro}
\lettrine[lines=3]{W}{hat are} the foundations of mathematics itself? This part examines the deepest questions: Can mathematics be reduced to logic? Are there mathematical truths beyond proof? What is the relationship between syntax and semantics?

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Metamathematics:} Mathematics studying itself
    \item \textbf{Model Theory:} Structures and their theories
    \item \textbf{Proof Theory:} The mathematics of proofs
    \item \textbf{Philosophical Implications:} What can we know?
\end{itemize}
