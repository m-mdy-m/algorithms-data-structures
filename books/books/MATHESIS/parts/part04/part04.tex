\label{part:indian-islamic}

\begin{partintro}
\lettrine[lines=3]{W}{hile Europe} struggled through its Dark Ages, mathematical brilliance flourished elsewhere. Indian mathematicians developed the decimal place-value system and conceived of zero as number—revolutionary insights that transformed human capacity for calculation. Islamic scholars preserved, synthesized, and extended Greek and Indian mathematics, creating algebra as a systematic discipline and developing sophisticated astronomical and geometric methods.

This part examines these transformative contributions: the philosophical and practical implications of zero, the development of positional decimal notation, al-Khwarizmi's systematization of algebra, and the geometric innovations of Persian and Arab mathematicians. We explore how these advances emerged from specific intellectual contexts and how they spread to reshape global mathematics.

\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Conceptual Revolution:} How zero changed mathematical possibility
    \item \textbf{Algebraic Thinking:} The emergence of symbolic manipulation as mathematical method
    \item \textbf{Cultural Synthesis:} How Islamic scholars unified diverse mathematical traditions
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency:} Practical mathematical methods for complex calculations
\end{itemize}
