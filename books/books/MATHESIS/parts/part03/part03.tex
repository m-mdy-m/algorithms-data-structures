\part{Algebraic Structures: Symmetry and Abstraction}
\label{part:algebra}

\begin{partintro}
\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{lgebra is} the study of structure. By abstracting the essential properties of mathematical operations—associativity, commutativity, identity, inverses—we discover profound unifying patterns. This part develops abstract algebra from groups through categories, revealing how seemingly disparate areas of mathematics share deep structural unity.

\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Structural Thinking:} Focus on morphisms and universal properties
    \item \textbf{Computational Algebra:} Algorithms for algebraic computation
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic Applications:} Group theory in RSA, elliptic curves
    \item \textbf{Categorical Perspective:} Algebra as the study of categories with structure
\end{itemize}
