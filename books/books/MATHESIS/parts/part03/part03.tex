\label{part:greek-mathematics}

\begin{partintro}
\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he Greeks transformed} mathematics from a computational tool into a philosophical discipline. They asked not merely "how to calculate?" but "why is this true?" Their demand for logical proof, their development of axiomatic systems, and their conception of mathematics asthe study of eternal, perfect forms fundamentally altered human intellectual history.

This part explores Greek mathematical philosophy from the Pythagoreans' mystical number theory through Euclid's systematic geometry to Archimedes' sophisticated methods of exhaustion. We examine how Greek philosophical commitments shaped mathematical practice, how logical rigor emerged as a mathematical virtue, and how Greek achievements influenced all subsequent mathematical development.

\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Philosophical Integration:} Mathematics as inseparable from metaphysics and epistemology
    \item \textbf{Proof Culture:} The emergence of demonstration as mathematical necessity
    \item \textbf{Geometric Focus:} Why Greeks privileged geometric over arithmetic reasoning
    \item \textbf{Logical Foundations:} Aristotelian logic as framework for mathematical thought
\end{itemize}
