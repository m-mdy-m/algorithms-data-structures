\part{Origins of Mathematical Thought}
\label{part:origins}

\begin{partintro}
\lettrine[lines=3]{M}{athematics did not} emerge fully formed from human minds. It was forged through millennia of necessity, observation, and intellectual struggle. Before symbols existed, before numbers had names, our ancestors confronted the fundamental challenge: how to comprehend and communicate quantity, pattern, and structure.

This part traces mathematics from its primordial origins—when humanity first distinguished "one" from "many"—through the revolutionary abstractions that made systematic thought possible. We examine not merely what ancient peoples calculated, but how they reasoned, what cognitive leaps enabled mathematical thinking, and why certain cultures developed particular mathematical frameworks.

\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Foundations:} We explore the neurological and psychological basis for mathematical intuition
    \item \textbf{Archaeological Evidence:} Physical artifacts reveal how abstract concepts became material reality
    \item \textbf{Cultural Contexts:} Mathematical systems emerged from specific human needs and worldviews
    \item \textbf{Conceptual Evolution:} We trace how simple counting became sophisticated abstraction
\end{itemize}
