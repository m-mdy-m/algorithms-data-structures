\part{Logic and the Foundations of Reasoning}
\label{part:logic-foundations}

\begin{partintro}
\lettrine[lines=3]{B}{efore mathematics}, there was logic. Before we can reason about numbers, structures, or algorithms, we must understand reasoning itself. This part develops the formal systems of propositional and predicate logic, proof theory, and the philosophical foundations that make mathematics possible.

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Philosophical Depth:} From Aristotelian syllogisms to modern proof assistants
    \item \textbf{Complete Formalization:} Natural deduction, sequent calculus, resolution
    \item \textbf{Computational Connection:} Logic as the foundation of programming languages
    \item \textbf{Metamathematical Results:} Completeness, soundness, decidability
\end{itemize}
