% Part Introduction/Epigraph
\begin{partintro}
	\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he foundation} of algorithmic analysis rests upon a bedrock of mathematical rigor and computational intuition. Before embarking on the journey of analyzing algorithms asymptotically, understanding recurrences, or diving into amortized analysis, we must first ensure our mathematical toolkit is complete and our understanding of fundamental concepts is solid.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	This part serves as both a review and a deep dive into the essential mathematical and algorithmic prerequisites that underpin everything that follows. Whether you are a student encountering these topics for the first time or a practitioner seeking to refresh your knowledge, this foundation will prepare you for the sophisticated analysis techniques explored in subsequent parts.
