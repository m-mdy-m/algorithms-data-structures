\begin{partintro}
	\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he art} of algorithmic analysis demands both mathematical 
	precision and computational intuition. This part provides the rigorous 
	mathematical foundation upon which all subsequent analysis techniques rest.

	Unlike typical prerequisite chapters that offer superficial reviews, we present 
	these topics with the depth required for advanced analysis: complete proofs, 
	non-trivial examples, and connections to algorithm design that you won't find 
	elsewhere.

	\vspace{1em}
	\textbf{What Makes This Different:}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item \textbf{Depth:} We prove theorems completely, not just state them
		\item \textbf{Motivation:} Every topic connects directly to algorithm analysis
		\item \textbf{Rigor:} We use precise mathematical language throughout
		\item \textbf{Practice:} Exercises range from warmup to research-level problems
	\end{itemize}
