\begin{partintro}
The interesting algorithms. Merge, diff, tree traversal, conflict resolution.

This is where complexity analysis matters.
\end{partintro}

\chapter{Three-Way Merge}
% Merge base algorithm
% LCA in DAG
% How conflicts are detected
% Complexity and optimization

\chapter{Merge Strategies}
% Recursive (default)
% Ours, theirs
% Octopus (multiple branches)
% Resolve, subtree
% When to use which

\chapter{Diff Algorithms}
% Myers' diff algorithm
% Patience diff
% Histogram diff
% Minimal vs patience: trade-offs
% Complexity: O(ND) where D is edit distance

\chapter{Tree Comparison}
% Comparing directory trees
% Recursive descent
% Optimization: hash comparison
% Unchanged subtrees: O(1)

\chapter{Object Lookup}
% Finding objects by hash
% Pack index format
% Binary search
% O(log n) lookup

\chapter{Reachability and Graph Traversal}
% Commit reachability
% git log implementation
% Topological sort
% Rev-list and its uses

\chapter{Blame and History Mining}
% git blame algorithm
% Line-level history
% Pickaxe (-S) and log -G
% Performance considerations
